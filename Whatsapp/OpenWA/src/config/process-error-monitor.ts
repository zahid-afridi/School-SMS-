 * in-memory state (the `engines`/`reconnectStates`/limiter maps could be mid-mutation) — we only add

 *
 * The body is guarded so a throw inside the monitor (a poisoned error whose `.stack` getter throws, a
 * `String()`-incompatible value, or a downed logger) can never mask the original fatal error or change
 * the exit code — the worst case degrades to losing this one log line while Node's default print + exit

 * One class is logged at WARN instead of ERROR: a Puppeteer rejection left behind when the page an
 * `evaluate` was waiting on goes away. whatsapp-web.js re-runs `inject()` from an async
 * `framenavigated` listener it never awaits, so a page navigation or an engine teardown turns that
 * still-pending evaluate into a rejection with no owner (#982). Either way the session recovers on its
 * own, and an ERROR with a raw Puppeteer stack reads like a crash.
 *
 * Deliberately scoped so nothing actionable is muted: the ACTIONABLE variant of the same message — a
 * browser profile left stale by an upgrade that changed the Chromium binary (#663/#708) — is thrown
 * from inside `engine.initialize()`, where the adapter catches it and logs its own advisory, so it
 * never reaches this handler. And only the severity changes: the full reason is still logged.
