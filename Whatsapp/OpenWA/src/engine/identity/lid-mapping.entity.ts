/**
 * Persisted `lid -> phone` resolution table on the `data` connection. One global, cross-session row per
 * lid (the maintainer wants the mapping shared, not per-session), so a lid resolved in one session/run is
 * usable everywhere and survives restarts - replacing the per-session, in-memory `lidToPn` map.
 *
 * Last-write-wins: a stored mapping is "best known, not forever" (WhatsApp recycles numbers), so it's a
 * cache WhatsApp can correct. `phone` is nullable to record a negative result (a lid we looked up and
 * could not resolve) so active lookups stay one-network-call-per-unknown-lid. `sessionId` is provenance
 * only (which session last wrote the row) - intentionally NOT a foreign key, since the row outlives any
 * one session.
