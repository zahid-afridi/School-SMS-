# 18 - SDK Design

## 18.1 Overview

OpenWA ships five official, hand-written client libraries for the REST API. They are not generated from an OpenAPI spec — each is written directly against the real API surface (paths, request DTOs, response shapes) and **unit-tested with a mocked HTTP transport that asserts on the exact request path, method, and body**, so drift in what an SDK *sends* is caught at test time rather than in production. That mechanism says nothing about what an SDK expects *back*; see §18.6 for how response shapes are held to the contract.

| Language | Package | Install | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| JavaScript / TypeScript | [`@rmyndharis/openwa`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rmyndharis/openwa) | `npm install @rmyndharis/openwa` | Dual ESM + CJS, bundled `.d.ts` types, Node 18+ |
| Python | [`rmyndharis-openwa`](https://pypi.org/project/rmyndharis-openwa/) | `pip install rmyndharis-openwa` | Synchronous (httpx), PEP 561 typed, Python 3.9+ |
| PHP | [`rmyndharis/openwa`](https://packagist.org/packages/rmyndharis/openwa) | `composer require rmyndharis/openwa` | Synchronous (Guzzle 7), PSR-4, PHP 8.1+ |
| Java | [`com.rmyndharis:openwa`](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.rmyndharis/openwa) | Maven Central | Sync, `java.net.http`. See [`sdk/java/README.md`](../sdk/java/README.md). |
| Go | [`github.com/rmyndharis/OpenWA/sdk/go`](../sdk/go) | `go get` | Stdlib-only, no third-party deps. See [`sdk/go/README.md`](../sdk/go/README.md). |

> The import names differ from the dist names where the ecosystem requires it. Python installs `rmyndharis-openwa` but imports `openwa`; the client class is `OpenWAClient` in JS/Python and `OpenWA\Client` in PHP.

### Design Principles

- **One client, fluent resources.** A single client object (`OpenWAClient` / `OpenWA\Client`) exposes every resource as a property — `client.messages.sendText(...)`, `client.sessions.start(...)`. All five SDKs expose the **same** resource surface; only the language idioms differ (camelCase methods + objects in JS/PHP/Java, snake_case methods + dicts in Python, exported fields + structs in Go).
- **It is a request/response client, not an event SDK.** There is no WebSocket, EventEmitter, or `client.on(...)`. To receive inbound messages and acks, register a webhook (the `webhooks` resource) and host your own receiver, or connect to the real-time Socket.IO API directly (see [API Specification §6.5](./06-api-specification.md)).
- **Typed errors.** Non-2xx responses raise/throw a typed error mapped from the HTTP status (`401/403/404/409/429/501`), plus a timeout error — all `instanceof`/`catch`-checkable. See each language's Error Handling subsection.
- **Injectable transport.** The HTTP layer is replaceable (`fetch` in JS, an `httpx` transport in Python, a Guzzle client in PHP) — the extension point for retry/observability middleware and for testing without the network.
- **Safe by default.** Redirects are never followed (so the API key is never re-sent to a redirect target), the auth/JSON headers always take precedence over caller-supplied defaults, path segments are percent-encoded, a base-URL path prefix (e.g. behind a reverse proxy at `/v1`) is preserved, and there is a default 30s per-request timeout. **No automatic retries by default** — in JS, Python, PHP, and Java wrap calls in your own backoff if you need them (especially for `429`); the Go SDK additionally ships an opt-in `WithRetry(RetryPolicy)` that never replays a `POST` after a network error and limits `POST` retries to `429`/`503`.

### Resource Coverage

All five SDKs expose the same fluent surface:

| Resource | Methods |
| --- | --- |
| `sessions` | list, get, create, delete, start, stop, logout, forceKill, getQrCode, requestPairingCode, stats |
| `messages` | list, sendText, sendImage/Video/Audio/Document/Sticker, sendLocation, sendContact, sendTemplate, sendPoll, reply, forward, react, delete, editMessage, history, reactions, sendBulk, batchStatus, cancelBatch |
| `contacts` | list, get, check, profilePicture, profilePictures, phone, block, unblock |
| `groups` | list, get, create, joinGroup, add/remove/promote/demoteParticipants, setSubject, setDescription, getGroupSettings, updateGroupSettings, leave, inviteCode, revokeInviteCode |
| `webhooks` | list, get, create, update, delete, test |
| `chats` | list, markRead, markUnread, delete, sendState |
| `labels` | list, get, forChat, addToChat, removeFromChat *(WhatsApp Business)* |
| `channels` | list, get, messages, subscribe, unsubscribe *(Newsletters)* |
| `catalog` | info, products, product, sendProduct, sendCatalog *(WhatsApp Business)* |
| `status` | list, fromContact, media, sendText, sendImage, sendVideo, delete *(Stories)* |
| `search` | search |
| `templates` | list, get, create, update, delete |
| `profile` | setProfileName, setProfileStatus, setProfilePicture |
| `calls` | rejectCall |
| `health` | check, live, ready |

> The SDKs cover the user-facing resources above and stop there. The administrative and operational surfaces are deliberately left out — `auth/api-keys`, `audit`, `settings`, `stats`, `infra`, `plugins` and the `integration` management routes are predominantly `ADMIN`-gated; `metrics` is a `@Public()` Prometheus scrape gated by `METRICS_TOKEN` rather than by role; `mcp` is a Streamable-HTTP transport mounted straight onto the Express adapter; and `ingress` is the `@Public()` receiver that integration providers post into. `docker` has no HTTP surface at all — it is an internal service module. Methods that require an `OPERATOR`-level key are annotated **OPERATOR** in the per-language tables below.

## 18.2 TypeScript / JavaScript SDK

The official JavaScript/TypeScript SDK is published as **`@rmyndharis/openwa`**. It is a pure promise-based HTTP client: a single `OpenWAClient` exposes every API resource as a typed property. There is no event model — the SDK does not open WebSockets, emit events, or expose `client.on(...)`. To receive inbound messages and acks, configure a webhook (see the `webhooks` resource) and host your own HTTP receiver.

The package ships **dual CJS + ESM** with bundled `.d.ts` types, so it is consumable from both `require()` and `import`.

### Installation

```bash
npm install @rmyndharis/openwa
# or
yarn add @rmyndharis/openwa
# or
pnpm add @rmyndharis/openwa
```

> **Node 18+ required.** The transport uses the global `fetch` (and `AbortController`), both built into Node 18 and later. To run on an older runtime, pass your own `fetch` implementation via the client constructor (see [Client Configuration](#client-configuration)).

### Quick Start

```typescript
import { OpenWAClient } from '@rmyndharis/openwa';

const client = new OpenWAClient({
  baseUrl: 'http://localhost:2785',
  apiKey: 'owa_k1_…',
});

async function main() {
  // Start a session and bring the WhatsApp connection up.
  await client.sessions.start('my-session');

  // Send a text message.
  const result = await client.messages.sendText('my-session', {
    chatId: '628123456789@c.us',
    text: 'Hello from the OpenWA SDK!',
  });

  console.log(result.messageId); // -> the WhatsApp message id
}

main();
```

`sendText` resolves to a `MessageResponse` (`{ messageId: string; timestamp: number }`). `timestamp` is the Unix epoch value returned by the API — **seconds**, passed through unchanged.

CommonJS consumers use the same API via `require`:

```javascript
const { OpenWAClient } = require('@rmyndharis/openwa');
```

### Client Configuration

The constructor takes a single `OpenWAClientOptions` object. `baseUrl` and `apiKey` are required (the constructor throws synchronously if either is missing).

| Option | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `baseUrl` | `string` | yes | — | Base URL of the OpenWA API, e.g. `http://localhost:2785`. A trailing slash is trimmed; a path prefix (e.g. `https://host/v1`) is preserved. |
| `apiKey` | `string` | yes | — | API key sent as the `X-API-Key` header on every request. |
| `timeoutMs` | `number` | no | `30000` | Per-request timeout in milliseconds. Overridable per call via `RequestOptions.timeoutMs` on the raw `request()` method. |
| `defaultHeaders` | `Record<string, string>` | no | `{}` | Headers merged onto every request. The `Content-Type: application/json` and `X-API-Key` headers always take precedence. |
| `fetch` | `FetchLike` | no | `globalThis.fetch` | Injectable transport (the WHATWG `fetch` signature). Use this to wrap requests with retry/observability middleware, or to supply a `fetch` on runtimes that lack a global one. |

### Resources & Methods

All resources are accessed as properties on the client (`client.<resource>.<method>`). Every method returns a `Promise`. Methods marked **OPERATOR** require an `OPERATOR`-level API key (an `ADMIN` key satisfies it); a `VIEWER` key receives a `403` (`OpenWAForbiddenError`).

The top-level client also exposes:

| Method | Signature | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `auth` | `client.auth()` | Validate the configured API key and resolve its role (`{ valid, role? }`). |
| `request` | `client.request<T>(options)` | Raw escape hatch — issue an arbitrary request against the API. |

#### `sessions`

| Method | Signature | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `list` | `list()` | List all sessions (scoped to the key's `allowedSessions`). |
| `get` | `get(id)` | Get a single session by id. |

| `start` | `start(id)` | Start a session and initialize the WhatsApp connection. **OPERATOR** |
| `stop` | `stop(id)` | Stop a session and disconnect gracefully. **OPERATOR** |
| `logout` | `logout(id)` | Attempt an engine-native unlink of this device, then stop the session. A `200` means the unlink + local cleanup completed (not an independent Linked-Devices observation); a later `start` needs a fresh QR. A `502` (`SESSION_LOGOUT_INCOMPLETE`) stops locally but leaves the operation incomplete; start and retry. Requires a running session. **OPERATOR** |
| `forceKill` | `forceKill(id)` | Force-kill a stuck session (SIGKILL + teardown). **OPERATOR** |
| `getQrCode` | `getQrCode(id)` | Get the current QR code for authentication (live from the engine). **OPERATOR** |
| `requestPairingCode` | `requestPairingCode(id, body)` | Request an 8-character pairing code for phone-based login. **OPERATOR** |
| `stats` | `stats()` | Aggregate statistics across the key's sessions. |

#### `messages`

### Error Handling

On a non-2xx response the SDK throws a typed `OpenWAApiError` subclass carrying `.status` (HTTP status), `.body` (parsed JSON error envelope, or raw text), and `.errorKind` (the NestJS `error` field). All error classes extend `OpenWAError` and are exported, so they are `instanceof`-checkable. A timeout throws `OpenWATimeoutError`, which extends `OpenWAError` directly (not `OpenWAApiError`).

| Error class | HTTP status | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OpenWAAuthError` | 401 | Missing or invalid API key. |
| `OpenWAForbiddenError` | 403 | The key's role is insufficient (e.g. an OPERATOR-only route). |
| `OpenWANotFoundError` | 404 | Resource not found. |
| `OpenWAConflictError` | 409 | Conflict — typically the engine is not ready. |
| `OpenWARateLimitError` | 429 | Rate limited. |
| `OpenWANotImplementedError` | 501 | The active engine does not support this operation. |
| `OpenWAApiError` | any other | Generic non-2xx (the base API error, e.g. `400`; also surfaced for unfollowed 3xx redirects). |
| `OpenWATimeoutError` | — | The request exceeded the configured timeout. |

```typescript
import {
  OpenWAClient,
  OpenWAConflictError,
  OpenWANotFoundError,
  OpenWARateLimitError,
  OpenWATimeoutError,
  OpenWAApiError,
} from '@rmyndharis/openwa';

try {
  await client.messages.sendText('my-session', {
    chatId: '628123456789@c.us',
    text: 'Hi!',
  });
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof OpenWAConflictError) {
    // 409 — engine not ready; start the session first.
  } else if (err instanceof OpenWANotFoundError) {
    // 404 — session/chat does not exist.
  } else if (err instanceof OpenWARateLimitError) {
    // 429 — back off and retry.
  } else if (err instanceof OpenWATimeoutError) {
    // request timed out.
  } else if (err instanceof OpenWAApiError) {
    console.error(`API error ${err.status}:`, err.body);
  } else {
    throw err; // network/transport error
  }
}
```

### Notable Behaviors

- **Redirects are never followed.** The transport uses `redirect: 'manual'`, so a `3xx` surfaces to the caller as an error (via `OpenWAApiError`) rather than being followed — this guarantees the `X-API-Key` header is never re-sent to a redirect target (potentially a different origin).
- **Auth and JSON headers take precedence.** Request headers are merged in the order `defaultHeaders` → per-call headers → `Content-Type: application/json` → `X-API-Key`. Both `Content-Type` and `X-API-Key` are applied last, so neither can be overridden by a caller-supplied header.
- **Path segments are percent-encoded.** Ids (session, chat, message, etc.) are encoded so a value cannot break out of its path position, while keeping the WhatsApp-safe characters `@`, `:`, and `+` readable (e.g. `628123456789@c.us`).
- **Base-URL path prefix is preserved.** A `baseUrl` such as `https://gateway.example.com/v1` keeps its `/v1` prefix on every request; only a trailing slash is trimmed.
- **No automatic retries.** A failed request rejects immediately — the SDK does not retry, even on `429`. Wrap calls in your own backoff if you need retries.
- **Injectable transport.** Supply a custom `fetch` to wrap outbound calls with retry, logging, or observability middleware, or to run on a runtime without a global `fetch`. This is also the recommended way to unit-test without monkey-patching globals.
- **Dual CJS + ESM.** The package exposes both an `import` (ESM) and `require` (CommonJS) entry point with bundled type declarations, so it works in either module system without configuration.

## 18.3 Python SDK

The Python SDK is a **synchronous** client built on [`httpx`](https://www.python-httpx.org/). It ships its own type hints (PEP 561) so editors and type-checkers see the full surface without stubs. There is **no async client and no event/streaming model** — every call is a blocking method that returns a plain `dict`/`list` (or `None` for a 204), and request payloads are plain `dict`s.

### Installation

The PyPI distribution name and the import package differ:

```bash
pip install rmyndharis-openwa
```

```python
from openwa import OpenWAClient
```

- **Distribution (PyPI):** `rmyndharis-openwa`
- **Import package:** `openwa`
- **Client class:** `OpenWAClient`
- **Python:** `>=3.9` (per `pyproject.toml`)
- **Runtime dependency:** `httpx>=0.25.0,<1.0`
- **Typed:** ships `py.typed` markers for `openwa` and `openwa.resources` (PEP 561)

### Quick Start

```python
from openwa import OpenWAClient

client = OpenWAClient(
    base_url="http://localhost:2785",
    api_key="owa_k1_…",
)

# Create then start a session
client.sessions.create({"name": "my-session"})
client.sessions.start("my-session")

# Send a text message
result = client.messages.send_text("my-session", {
    "chatId": "628123456789@c.us",
    "text": "Hello from the OpenWA Python SDK!",
})
print(result["messageId"])

client.close()
```

`OpenWAClient` is also a context manager, so the connection pool is closed for you:

```python
with OpenWAClient(base_url="http://localhost:2785", api_key="owa_k1_…") as client:
    print(client.health.check())
```

### Client Configuration

Constructor signature (from `client.py`):

```python
OpenWAClient(
    base_url: str,
    api_key: str,
    *,
    timeout: float = 30.0,
    default_headers: Mapping[str, str] | None = None,
    transport: httpx.BaseTransport | None = None,
)
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `base_url` | `str` | *(required)* | Gateway base URL, e.g. `http://localhost:2785`. Raises `ValueError` if empty. A trailing `/` is stripped; any path prefix is preserved. |
| `api_key` | `str` | *(required)* | API key sent as the `X-API-Key` header. Raises `ValueError` if empty. |
| `timeout` | `float` | `30.0` | Per-request timeout in seconds. A breach raises `OpenWATimeoutError`. |
| `default_headers` | `Mapping[str, str] \| None` | `None` | Extra headers applied to every request. Applied **first**, so the SDK's `X-API-Key` and `Content-Type: application/json` always win. |
| `transport` | `httpx.BaseTransport \| None` | `None` | Optional `httpx` transport override (e.g. `httpx.MockTransport`) sharing the one connection pool. Useful for testing. |

The client also exposes a few non-resource members:

| Member | Signature | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

### Resources & Methods

Resources are accessed as properties on the client (e.g. `client.messages`). All methods are **snake_case**; `body`/`query` arguments are plain dicts. Methods marked **OPERATOR** require an `OPERATOR`-level API key.

#### `client.sessions`

| Method | Signature | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

### Error Handling

Every error inherits from `OpenWAError`. A non-2xx response raises an `OpenWAApiError` (or a more specific subclass picked by status); a timeout raises `OpenWATimeoutError`. The API-error classes carry `.status` (HTTP code), `.body` (parsed JSON or raw text), and `.error_kind` (the NestJS `error` field).

| Exception | Trigger |
| --- | --- |
| `OpenWAAuthError` | HTTP `401` — missing or invalid API key |
| `OpenWAForbiddenError` | HTTP `403` — insufficient role |
| `OpenWANotFoundError` | HTTP `404` — resource not found |
| `OpenWAConflictError` | HTTP `409` — typically engine-not-ready |
| `OpenWARateLimitError` | HTTP `429` — too many requests |
| `OpenWANotImplementedError` | HTTP `501` — active engine doesn't support the operation |
| `OpenWAApiError` | any other non-2xx status (incl. unfollowed `3xx`) |
| `OpenWATimeoutError` | request exceeded `timeout` (has a `.timeout` attribute) |

```python
from openwa import (
    OpenWAClient,
    OpenWAConflictError,
    OpenWANotFoundError,
    OpenWARateLimitError,
    OpenWATimeoutError,
    OpenWAApiError,
)

client = OpenWAClient(base_url="http://localhost:2785", api_key="owa_k1_…")

try:
    client.messages.send_text("my-session", {
        "chatId": "628123456789@c.us",
        "text": "Hi!",
    })
except OpenWAConflictError:
    print("Session engine not ready yet — start it first.")
except OpenWANotFoundError:
    print("Session does not exist.")
except OpenWARateLimitError:
    print("Rate limited — back off and retry.")
except OpenWATimeoutError as e:
    print(f"Timed out after {e.timeout}s")
except OpenWAApiError as e:
    print(f"API error {e.status} ({e.error_kind}): {e.body}")
```

### Notable Behaviors

- **Redirects are never followed.** `follow_redirects` is forced off so the `X-API-Key` header is never re-sent to a redirect target. An unfollowed `3xx` therefore surfaces as an `OpenWAApiError` rather than a success.
- **Auth/JSON headers always win.** `default_headers` are applied first; the SDK then sets `Content-Type: application/json` and `X-API-Key`, so caller headers can never clobber them.
- **Path segments are percent-encoded.** Each path value (session/chat/message id, etc.) is encoded so a `/`, `#`, or `?` can't break out of its position; already-safe id characters `@`, `:`, `+` are left readable. Boolean query params are serialized lowercase (`true`/`false`); `None` query values are dropped.
- **Base-URL path prefix is preserved.** A trailing `/` is stripped from `base_url`, but any path prefix (e.g. when running behind a reverse proxy) is kept on every request.
- **No automatic retries.** Each call issues exactly one request; retry/backoff is the caller's responsibility. Wrap or inject a custom `transport` for retry or observability middleware.
- **Testable transport injection.** Pass `transport=httpx.MockTransport(handler)` to intercept requests in tests — no global monkey-patching.
- **204 / non-JSON handling.** A `204` (or empty body) returns `None`; a 2xx body that isn't valid JSON is returned as raw text instead of raising.
- **PEP 561 typed.** The package ships `py.typed`, so type-checkers consume the bundled hints directly.

## 18.4 PHP SDK

The PHP SDK is a hand-written, synchronous client built on Guzzle 7. It mirrors the full user-facing API surface: every resource method maps to one REST endpoint, request/response payloads are plain associative arrays, and non-2xx responses are translated into a typed `OpenWA*Exception` hierarchy.

### Installation

```bash
composer require rmyndharis/openwa
```

Requirements:

- **PHP 8.1+** (`declare(strict_types=1)` throughout; typed properties, `match`).
- **Guzzle 7** (`guzzlehttp/guzzle: ^7.9`).
- PSR-4 autoloaded under the `OpenWA\` namespace (`"OpenWA\\": "src/"`).

### Quick Start

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use OpenWA\Client;

$client = new Client([
    'baseUrl' => 'http://localhost:2785',
    'apiKey'  => 'owa_k1_…',
]);

$client->sessions->start('my-session');

$result = $client->messages->sendText('my-session', [
    'chatId' => '628123456789@c.us',
    'text'   => 'Hello from the OpenWA PHP SDK!',
]);

echo $result['messageId'];
```

The entry class is `OpenWA\Client`. It validates that `baseUrl` and `apiKey` are present (throwing `OpenWAException` otherwise), constructs the shared HTTP transport, and exposes each resource as a public property: `$client->sessions`, `$client->messages`, `$client->search`, `$client->contacts`, `$client->groups`, `$client->webhooks`, `$client->chats`, `$client->status`, `$client->health`, `$client->labels`, `$client->channels`, `$client->catalog`, `$client->templates`, `$client->profile`, `$client->calls`.

Two escape hatches sit on the client itself:

| Method | Signature | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `auth` | `auth(): array` | `POST /api/auth/validate` — validate the configured key and resolve its role. |
| `request` | `request(string $method, string $path, array $query = [], mixed $body = null): mixed` | Raw request against any path (advanced use); returns decoded JSON or `null` for empty/204. |

### Client Configuration

The constructor takes a single associative `$config` array:

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `baseUrl` | `string` | — (**required**) | API base URL, e.g. `http://localhost:2785`. A trailing `/` is stripped; any path prefix (e.g. `/v1` behind a proxy) is preserved. |
| `apiKey` | `string` | — (**required**) | Sent as the `X-API-Key` header on every request. |
| `timeout` | `float` | `30.0` | Per-request timeout in seconds. |
| `httpClient` | `?\GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface` | `null` | Inject a Guzzle client (e.g. one built on a `MockHandler`) for testing or middleware. When `null`, a default Guzzle client is created with the configured timeout. |
| `defaultHeaders` | `array<string,string>` | `[]` | Extra headers applied on every request, **under** the SDK's auth/JSON headers (which always win). |

Missing `baseUrl` or `apiKey` throws `OpenWA\Exceptions\OpenWAException` from the constructor.

### Resources & Methods

All payloads are associative arrays; all listed methods are synchronous and return the decoded JSON (an `array`), except the `void` deletes. Methods marked **OPERATOR** require an operator-level API key.

### Error Handling

All exceptions live in `OpenWA\Exceptions` and descend from `OpenWAException` (which extends PHP's `\Exception`). Any non-2xx response is raised as an `OpenWAApiException`; the static `classify()` factory picks the most specific subclass by status code. An `OpenWAApiException` carries the HTTP status (`getStatus(): int`), the parsed error body (`getBody(): mixed`), and the NestJS `error` kind when present (`getErrorKind(): ?string`).

| Exception | Extends | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OpenWAException` | `\Exception` | Base for all SDK errors (also thrown for missing `baseUrl`/`apiKey`). |
| `OpenWAApiException` | `OpenWAException` | Any non-2xx (including unfollowed 3xx and other 4xx/5xx). |
| `OpenWAAuthException` | `OpenWAApiException` | `401` — missing/invalid API key. |
| `OpenWAForbiddenException` | `OpenWAApiException` | `403` — insufficient role (e.g. operator-only endpoint). |
| `OpenWANotFoundException` | `OpenWAApiException` | `404` — resource not found. |
| `OpenWAConflictException` | `OpenWAApiException` | `409` — conflict (e.g. engine not ready). |
| `OpenWARateLimitException` | `OpenWAApiException` | `429` — rate limited. |
| `OpenWANotImplementedException` | `OpenWAApiException` | `501` — active engine does not support the operation. |
| `OpenWATimeoutException` | `OpenWAException` | Request exceeded the timeout (`getTimeout(): float`). Not an API error — has no status/body. |

```php
<?php
use OpenWA\Client;
use OpenWA\Exceptions\OpenWAConflictException;
use OpenWA\Exceptions\OpenWARateLimitException;
use OpenWA\Exceptions\OpenWATimeoutException;
use OpenWA\Exceptions\OpenWAApiException;

try {
    $result = $client->messages->sendText('my-session', [
        'chatId' => '628123456789@c.us',
        'text'   => 'Hello!',
    ]);
} catch (OpenWAConflictException $e) {
    // 409 — engine not ready yet
} catch (OpenWARateLimitException $e) {
    // 429 — back off and retry yourself (no auto-retry)
} catch (OpenWATimeoutException $e) {
    fwrite(STDERR, "timed out after {$e->getTimeout()}s\n");
} catch (OpenWAApiException $e) {
    // any other non-2xx
    fwrite(STDERR, "API {$e->getStatus()}: {$e->getMessage()}\n");
    var_dump($e->getBody());
}
```

### Notable Behaviors

- **Redirects are never followed.** Guzzle is configured with `allow_redirects => false`, so a `3xx` surfaces as an `OpenWAApiException` rather than being followed — the `X-API-Key` header is never re-sent to a redirect target.
- **Auth/JSON headers take precedence.** `defaultHeaders` are merged in first, then `X-API-Key`, `Content-Type: application/json`, and `Accept: application/json` are applied on top, so they can't be clobbered.
- **Path segments are percent-encoded.** Ids (chat/message/group ids, session names) pass through `encodeSegment()`, which `rawurlencode`s the value but keeps the WhatsApp-id-safe characters `@`, `:`, and `+` readable — so a value containing `/`, `#`, or `?` cannot break out of its path position.
- **Base-URL path prefix is preserved.** The base URL has its trailing `/` trimmed and requests are issued against an absolute `baseUrl . $path`; Guzzle's `base_uri` is intentionally unset, so a prefix like `/v1` behind a reverse proxy is retained.
- **Null query values are dropped.** Absent optional query parameters (`null`) are filtered out before the request, so they are never sent.
- **No automatic retries.** A failed request throws immediately; wrap calls in your own backoff if you need retries (notably for `429`). The injectable `httpClient` is the extension point for retry/observability middleware.
- **Empty/204 responses return `null`.** A `204` or empty body decodes to `null`; resource methods that promise an `array` coalesce this to `[]` (or to the resource object for single-item gets).
- **Testing without the network.** Inject a Guzzle client built on a `GuzzleHttp\Handler\MockHandler` via the `httpClient` config key — no global state, no live calls. The shipped test suite asserts on the exact path, method, and body.
- **PSR-4 autoloading.** Everything lives under the `OpenWA\` namespace mapped to `src/`; `composer require rmyndharis/openwa` wires up the autoloader.

## 18.5 n8n Community Node

OpenWA's n8n integration is **not** part of these SDK packages. It is a separate community node maintained in its own repository, which speaks the same REST + webhook contract documented in [API Specification](./06-api-specification.md):

- An **action/HTTP** path that calls the REST endpoints (e.g. `POST /api/sessions/:id/messages/send-text`) with the `X-API-Key` header.
- A **trigger** path that registers a webhook (the `webhooks` resource) and receives inbound events, verifying the `X-OpenWA-Signature` HMAC.

For installation and node-by-node configuration, see the dedicated [n8n Integration guide](./22-n8n-integration.md). Because the node consumes the public API contract, the verified route/event reference in docs 06 and §6.6 (Webhook Events) is the authority for what it can call and receive.

## 18.6 SDK Versioning & Releases

### Versioning

The five SDKs are versioned **independently of the gateway** and of each other, each following SemVer. An SDK version does **not** track the gateway version — check the registry for the current one rather than inferring it from the gateway's. Pin the SDK version your code is tested against and treat a major SDK bump as potentially breaking.

| SDK | Registry | Package |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JavaScript/TypeScript | npm | `@rmyndharis/openwa` |
| Python | PyPI | `rmyndharis-openwa` |
| PHP | Packagist | `rmyndharis/openwa` |
| Java | Maven Central | `com.rmyndharis:openwa` |
| Go | (none — module path) | `github.com/rmyndharis/OpenWA/sdk/go` |

### Contract-drift protection

The wire types live in a dedicated module (`types.ts` / `types.py`) so they can later be regenerated by an OpenAPI codegen pass without touching the hand-written resource methods.

**Requests.** Each SDK's test suite mocks the HTTP transport and **asserts on the exact request path, method, and body** — so a drift between an SDK method and the real API (the class of bug that once shipped `messages/text` instead of the real `messages/send-text`) breaks a test rather than reaching users.

**Responses.** That is a different problem, and for a long time nothing covered it — #754 is the proof: the status, label, and channel record types drifted from the engine interface for releases without a single test noticing, because asserting the request says nothing about the reply. It is not covered by `openapi:check` either: those controllers declare no typed `@ApiResponse`, so `openapi.json` carries no response schema for them and there is nothing to diff. The gate is now `sdk/javascript/test/wire-contract.test-d.ts` — a type-level test where `tsc --noEmit` (run by `npm test` ahead of vitest) fails if a record type stops matching the engine-neutral shape as it arrives over JSON. Its `Wire*` types are **maintained by hand**: `sdk-ci.yml` re-runs the job when `whatsapp-engine.interface.ts` changes, but keeping the two in step is a human step, not a generated one.

### Release process

```bash
# JavaScript
cd sdk/javascript && npm test && npm run build && npm run smoke   # smoke = require()+import() packaging check
# Python
cd sdk/python && python -m pytest -q
# PHP
cd sdk/php && composer install && ./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

CI runs all five suites (`sdk-ci.yml`), path-filtered to `sdk/**` plus the server-side contract surfaces the SDKs are written against — `src/**/dto/**`, `src/**/*.controller.ts`, `src/**/*.service.ts` and `whatsapp-engine.interface.ts` — so a change to the wire contract re-runs them. The PHP package is mirrored to its own Packagist repository via a `git subtree split`, and that mirror publish is gated on the PHP tests passing, so a broken SDK cannot auto-publish. Bump the version, update the SDK's CHANGELOG, run the suite above, then tag/publish to the relevant registry.
