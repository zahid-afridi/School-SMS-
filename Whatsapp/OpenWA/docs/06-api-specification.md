# 06 - API Specification

## 6.1 API Overview

### Base URL

Every REST route is mounted under the global `api` prefix:

```
http://<host>:2785/api
```

For local development that is `http://localhost:2785/api`; behind a reverse proxy substitute your public origin (the `/api` prefix is unchanged).

### Authentication

A global API-key guard protects every route unless it is explicitly marked **public** (`@Public()`). Send the key in the `X-API-Key` header:

```http
X-API-Key: owa_k1_your-api-key-here
```

> **Auth is header-only (never in a URL).** A query-parameter API key is **not** accepted anywhere. REST routes take the key via the `X-API-Key` header; the WebSocket (Socket.IO) handshake — see §6.5 Real-time API — accepts it via the handshake `auth.apiKey` field or the `X-API-Key` header. The former `?apiKey=` query fallback was **removed** (it leaked the credential into proxy/access logs). Never put the key in a URL.

The metrics endpoint is the lone exception to the API-key scheme: it authenticates with `Authorization: Bearer <METRICS_TOKEN>` instead of `X-API-Key`.

### Common Headers

```http
X-API-Key: owa_k1_your-api-key      # required on every non-public REST route
Content-Type: application/json       # required on requests with a JSON body
```

`Content-Type: application/json` is only needed when sending a body. There is no required `Accept` or `X-Request-ID` header.

### Roles & Authorization

API keys carry one of three roles, ordered by privilege:

| Role | Rank | Can do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `viewer` | 1 | Read-only routes (no `@RequireRole`, or routes that only need a valid key) |
| `operator` | 2 | Everything a viewer can, plus write/action routes guarded by `@RequireRole(OPERATOR)` (send messages, group/contact mutations, etc.) |
| `admin` | 3 | Everything, plus admin-only routes guarded by `@RequireRole(ADMIN)` (API-key management, settings) |

`@RequireRole(role)` enforces a **minimum** role using the hierarchy `VIEWER < OPERATOR < ADMIN`: a key satisfies the guard if its own rank is ≥ the required rank (so an `admin` key passes an `OPERATOR`-guarded route). A route with no `@RequireRole` accepts any valid key, including `viewer`. A key whose role is below the requirement gets `403 Forbidden`; a missing or invalid key gets `401 Unauthorized`.

A key may additionally be scoped to specific sessions (`allowedSessions`) and/or source IPs (`allowedIps`). The scope/IP check runs in the guard **before** any role check, so a request outside that scope is rejected with `401` (not `403`) even if the role would otherwise allow it.

### API-Key Lifecycle

OpenWA seeds an initial admin key on first run (printed to the startup log and written to `data/.api-key`, or `/app/data/.api-key` in Docker). Use it to mint scoped, lower-privilege keys for integrations. Full key creation, listing, rotation, and revocation are documented under the auth resource in **§6.4.9 (API Keys)**.

## 6.2 Response Format

> **OpenWA returns the raw handler payload directly — there is NO `{ success, data, meta }` envelope.** A resource route returns the resource object as-is; a list route returns a **bare JSON array**. Read fields directly (`response.id`, not `response.data.id`).

### Success Response

A successful request returns the resource (or array) exactly as the handler produced it:

```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "name": "my-session",
  "status": "ready"
}
```

List endpoints return a bare array (some paginated list routes instead return a small wrapper such as `{ "messages": [...], "total": 42 }` — the per-endpoint docs state the exact shape):

```json
[
  { "id": "…", "name": "session-a" },
  { "id": "…", "name": "session-b" }
]
```

Session `status` wire values are **lowercase**: `created | initializing | qr_ready | authenticating | ready | disconnected | action_required | failed`.

### Error Response

Errors use the NestJS default shape. The HTTP status is on the status line and mirrored in `statusCode`; there is no application-specific `code` field:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 404,
  "message": "Session 'my-session' not found",
  "error": "Not Found"
}
```

Validation failures (`statusCode: 400`) return `message` as an **array** of field-level strings. A global `ValidationPipe` runs with `whitelist` + `forbidNonWhitelisted`, so any request-body field not declared on the DTO is rejected with `400`.

### General Error Codes

| HTTP Status | Meaning | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `400` | Bad Request | DTO validation failed, unknown body field, or a business precondition not met (e.g. session not active, media over cap) |
| `401` | Unauthorized | Missing/invalid/expired/revoked `X-API-Key` (or `METRICS_TOKEN` for metrics), a blocked source IP, or a key used outside its `allowedSessions` scope |
| `403` | Forbidden | A valid, in-scope key whose **role** is below the route's `@RequireRole` requirement |
| `404` | Not Found | The addressed resource (session, message, webhook, batch, …) does not exist |
| `409` | Conflict | A uniqueness constraint was violated (e.g. duplicate name), or a credential teardown for the same session name is still in flight on `start`/`delete` (retryable; body carries `code: 'SESSION_NAME_TEARDOWN_PENDING'`) |
| `413` | Payload Too Large | Base64 media exceeds the media byte cap (see §6.3) |
| `500` | Internal Server Error | Send failed at the WhatsApp engine or an unexpected server error |

### Timestamp Conventions

OpenWA uses **two** timestamp representations — be careful which a field is:

- **Message timestamps are epoch numbers (Unix seconds), not ISO strings.** This applies to the `timestamp` field on messages returned by send responses, history, and persisted message records (the persisted column is stored as a bigint and surfaced as a `number`).
- **Entity audit fields use ISO-8601 UTC strings** (example: `2026-02-02T10:00:00.000Z`). This applies to `createdAt` / `updatedAt` on persisted entities, `expiresAt`, batch `startedAt` / `completedAt`, and similar metadata fields.

## 6.3 Media Specifications

### Media DTO (flat shape)

All media send routes (`send-image`, `send-video`, `send-audio`, `send-document`, `send-sticker`) share one **flat** request DTO — `SendMediaMessageDto`. There is **no** nested `{ image: { url } }` wrapper; the media source fields sit at the top level of the body:

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `chatId` | string | yes | non-empty | Recipient — `<phone>@c.us` or `<groupId>@g.us` |
| `url` | string | conditional | valid http/https URL; required when `base64` absent | Remote media URL. Fetched server-side through an SSRF guard; a blocked/internal URL yields `400` |
| `base64` | string | conditional | required when `url` absent | Raw base64 media data. Decoded size is checked against the media cap |
| `mimetype` | string | conditional | required when `base64` is used | MIME type, e.g. `image/jpeg`, `video/mp4`, `application/pdf` |
| `filename` | string | no | max 255 chars | Optional file name (also used as the persisted body fallback for documents) |
| `caption` | string | no | max 1024 chars | Optional caption (not persisted for audio) |
| `mentions` | string[] | no | array of WIDs | WIDs to @mention in the caption (e.g. `["62811@c.us"]`). See **Mentions** below |

Provide **exactly one** of `url` or `base64`. Omitting both, or supplying `base64` without `mimetype`, returns `400`.

A document sent without a `filename` is delivered under the default name `file` — on the whatsapp-web.js engine, a URL-based send first derives the URL basename before that fallback applies.

```json
{
  "chatId": "6281234567890@c.us",
  "url": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  "caption": "Check out this image!"
}
```

```json
{
  "chatId": "6281234567890@c.us",
  "base64": "/9j/4AAQSkZJRg...",
  "mimetype": "image/jpeg",
  "filename": "photo.jpg"
}
```

### Size Limit

There is a **single shared media byte cap**, not a per-type table. A base64 (or downloaded) media blob whose **decoded** size exceeds the cap is rejected with `413 Payload Too Large`. The cap is `MEDIA_DOWNLOAD_MAX_BYTES`, default **50 MiB (52,428,800 bytes)**; the same value bounds outbound base64 sends, remote-URL downloads, and inbound media. A non-positive or garbage override falls back to the default.

### Text Limit

`send-text` enforces a maximum body length of **4096 characters** (`text` is `@MaxLength(4096)`). Media captions are limited to **1024 characters**.

### Mentions

`send-text` and the media send routes accept an optional `mentions` array of WIDs (`<phone>@c.us`) to tag participants — most useful in groups. Two things are required for WhatsApp to render a tag and notify the participant:

1. The `mentions` array lists the WID(s), e.g. `["62811@c.us"]`.
2. The `text`/`caption` contains the matching `@<number>` token, e.g. `Hello @62811`.

The contract is engine-neutral: pass neutral `@c.us` WIDs and the active engine (whatsapp-web.js or Baileys) de-normalizes them internally. Whether a mention surfaces a notification is ultimately client-side — outside a shared group some clients may not render it.

### Send response: `201` means accepted, not delivered

Single-recipient send routes under `/messages` return **HTTP 201** with `{ "messageId", "timestamp" }` as soon as the gateway hands the message to the WhatsApp client. This confirms the send was *accepted* — it does **not** confirm the recipient received it. Two routes differ: `POST send-bulk` returns **202** with a batch envelope (`{ batchId, status, totalMessages, … }`), and the `status/send-*` routes return **201** with `{ statusId, timestamp, expiresAt }` — a `statusId`, not a `messageId`, and an ISO timestamp rather than epoch seconds.

Two consequences worth knowing:

1. **WhatsApp does not reject an unregistered recipient synchronously.** A message to a number that is not on WhatsApp still returns `201` with a valid `messageId`. Whether it later delivers, stalls, or is reported as an error reaches you asynchronously, if at all.
2. **There is no synchronous delivery confirmation on either engine** (whatsapp-web.js or Baileys), so the `201` cannot be made to mean "delivered."

**Before sending to a new number**, you can confirm it is a registered WhatsApp account with `GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/contacts/check/:number` (returns `{ exists, whatsappId }`; see the Contacts reference).

**For real delivery state**, track the stored message's `status`, which advances asynchronously as WhatsApp sends acks: `sent → delivered → read`, or `failed` when WhatsApp reports an error for the message — which also dispatches a `message.failed` webhook. See the message shape under the Messages reference.

A message resting at `sent` is **not** diagnostic on its own. It means no ack has advanced it yet, and a registered recipient whose device has not come online since the send stays at `sent` indefinitely too — that is the designed behavior, not a fault. Use `contacts/check` to tell an unregistered number apart from a registered one that simply has not received yet.

## 6.4 REST API Reference

Every path below is prefixed with `/api`. Unless marked **public**, send `X-API-Key: <key>`; `OPERATOR`/`ADMIN` annotations require a key of at least that role. Responses are the raw payload (no envelope); list endpoints return a bare array.

### 6.4.1 Sessions

Base path `/api/sessions`. All routes that return a session return data shaped by `SessionResponseDto.fromEntity` (via `transformSession`), which **strips** `config`, `proxyUrl`, and `proxyType` and renames the entity field `lastActiveAt` to `lastActive`. Session `status` wire values are lowercase: `created | initializing | qr_ready | authenticating | ready | disconnected | action_required | failed`.

#### GET /api/sessions

List all sessions, scoped to the API key's `allowedSessions`, ordered `createdAt` DESC.

**Auth:** API key  ·  **Scope:** session-scoped (a scoped key sees only its `allowedSessions`; an ADMIN / null-allowlist key lists all)

**Query parameters**

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `limit` | integer (1-1000) | No | `1000` | Max sessions to return; oversized/non-finite values are clamped/fallback to the default window. |
| `offset` | integer | No | `0` | Sessions to skip for paging; negative/non-finite values resolve to `0`. |

**Response** `200`

```json
[
  {
    "id": "8f3c2b1a-9d4e-4c7a-8b2f-1e6d5a4c3b2a",
    "name": "my-bot",
    "status": "ready",
    "phone": "6281234567890",
    "pushName": "My Bot",
    "connectedAt": "2026-06-25T08:14:02.000Z",
    "lastActive": "2026-06-25T09:01:55.000Z",
    "createdAt": "2026-06-20T11:30:00.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2026-06-25T09:01:55.000Z",
    "lastError": null,
    "engineLoaded": true
  }
]
```

`lastError` is non-null only when `status` is `failed` or `action_required`; any other status clears it. `config`/`proxyUrl`/`proxyType` are not present (stripped by `fromEntity`).

`engineLoaded` reports whether the gateway holds a live engine for the session at the moment of the response. It is the precondition the lifecycle routes enforce, and **`status` is not a substitute for it**: `disconnected` covers both a session whose engine is still registered while an automatic reconnect backs off — where `POST /start` answers `400` — and one stopped through `POST /stop`, which has no engine and does need a start. When `engineLoaded` is `true`, `stop`, `logout` and `force-kill` can act; when it is `false`, `start` is the applicable route. The field is derived per request from live process state, so it is never persisted and never appears in historical/exported data.

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key`

#### GET /api/sessions/:id

Get a single session by ID.

**Auth:** API key  ·  **Scope:** session-scoped (key's `allowedSessions` enforced against `:id`)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | WhatsApp session UUID |

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "id": "8f3c2b1a-9d4e-4c7a-8b2f-1e6d5a4c3b2a",
  "name": "my-bot",
  "status": "ready",
  "phone": "6281234567890",
  "pushName": "My Bot",
  "connectedAt": "2026-06-25T08:14:02.000Z",
  "lastActive": "2026-06-25T09:01:55.000Z",
  "createdAt": "2026-06-20T11:30:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-06-25T09:01:55.000Z",
  "lastError": null,
  "engineLoaded": true
}
```

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid key, or key not scoped to this session · `404` session not found

#### GET /api/sessions/:id/qr

Get the QR code (PNG data URL) for session authentication.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)  ·  **Scope:** session-scoped

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Session UUID |

**Response** `200` — `QRCodeResponseDto`

```json
{
  "qrCode": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA...",
  "status": "qr_ready"
}
```

`status` is the session's current lowercase status.

**Errors:** `400` session not started / QR not ready yet / already authenticated · `401` · `403` · `404` not found

#### GET /api/sessions/:id/groups

Get all groups the session is a member of (paginated).

**Auth:** API key  ·  **Scope:** session-scoped

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Session UUID |

**Query parameters**

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `limit` | integer (1–1000) | No | `1000` | Max groups to return |
| `offset` | integer | No | `0` | Number of groups to skip for paging |

**Response** `200`

```json
[
  { "id": "1234567890-123@g.us", "name": "Project Team", "linkedParentJID": null }
]
```

Bare array mapped from the engine's group list then paginated. `linkedParentJID` is present for community-linked groups.

**Errors:** `400` session not started (engine not in memory) · `401` · `403` · `404` session not found

#### GET /api/sessions/:id/chats

Get active chats for a session, most-recent first (paginated).

**Auth:** API key  ·  **Scope:** session-scoped

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Session UUID |

**Query parameters**

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `limit` | integer (1–1000) | No | `1000` | Max chats to return |
| `offset` | integer | No | `0` | Chats to skip for paging |

**Response** `200` — `ChatSummary[]`

```json
[
  {
    "id": "6281234567890@c.us",
    "name": "Alice",
    "isGroup": false,
    "kind": "individual",
    "unreadCount": 2,
    "timestamp": 1719306115,
    "lastMessage": "See you tomorrow"
  }
]
```

Sorted by `timestamp` DESC (most recent first) then paginated. `timestamp` is an epoch number (seconds). `kind` is the user-facing chat discriminator — one of `individual|group|channel|status|broadcast|unknown`; `isGroup` is retained for back-compat (true only for `kind: "group"`).

**Errors:** `400` session not started · `401` · `403` · `404` session not found

#### GET /api/sessions/stats/overview

Get session statistics for multi-session monitoring.

**Auth:** API key  ·  **Scope:** session-scoped (aggregate counts limited to the key's `allowedSessions`)

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "total": 4,
  "active": 2,
  "ready": 2,
  "disconnected": 1,
  "byStatus": { "ready": 2, "disconnected": 1, "created": 1 },
  "memoryUsage": { "heapUsed": 142, "heapTotal": 210, "rss": 318 }
}
```

`byStatus` is keyed by lowercase status values. `memoryUsage` values are megabytes (`Math.round(bytes / 1024 / 1024)`). `active` = count of running engines. A scoped key sees only its `allowedSessions` stats.

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key`

#### POST /api/sessions

Create a new WhatsApp session.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR) that is not restricted to specific sessions. Creating a session is a deployment-level act: the new session is outside the caller's `allowedSessions` by construction, so a session-scoped key is rejected with `403` (`@RequireUnscopedKey`). An unscoped OPERATOR/ADMIN key may create a session.

**Request body** — `CreateSessionDto`

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | Yes | `@IsString`; length 3–50; `@Matches(/^[a-zA-Z0-9-]+$/)` (letters, numbers, hyphens only) | Unique session name; duplicate → `409` |
| `config` | object | No | `@IsOptional` (arbitrary object, no shape validation) | Opaque engine config; defaults to `{}`; never returned in responses |
| `proxyUrl` | string | No | `@IsOptional`; `@IsString`; max 255; `@IsUrl` (protocols `http`/`https`/`socks4`/`socks5`, `require_protocol`, `require_tld:false`, `allow_underscores`) | Per-session proxy egress; credentialed `http://user:pass@host` and single-label hosts allowed; not SSRF-blocked. ⚠ **Must be a real, reachable proxy** — an unreachable value silently blocks the WhatsApp WebSocket (no QR, start → `504`); leave unset unless you need it. See "Per-session egress proxy" below. |
| `proxyType` | `http` \| `https` \| `socks4` \| `socks5` | No | `@IsOptional`; `@IsIn([...])` | Proxy protocol |

```json
{
  "name": "my-bot",
  "config": { "autoReconnect": true }
}
```

Minimal: `{ "name": "my-bot" }`.

**Optional — per-session egress proxy.** Route a session's traffic through a proxy only if your
network cannot reach WhatsApp directly. Set `proxyUrl`/`proxyType` on the same request:

```json
{
  "name": "my-bot",
  "proxyUrl": "http://user:pass@your-real-proxy.host:8080",
  "proxyType": "http"
}
```

> ⚠ `proxyUrl` **must point at a real, reachable proxy server.** A placeholder or unreachable value
> (e.g. `http://proxy.example.com:8080`) launches the engine pinned to a dead proxy, so the WhatsApp
> WebSocket never connects, **no QR code is ever delivered**, and `POST /api/sessions/:id/start`
> returns `504 Gateway Timeout` after ~30s. Leave `proxyUrl` unset unless you genuinely need a proxy.

**Response** `201`

```json
{
  "id": "8f3c2b1a-9d4e-4c7a-8b2f-1e6d5a4c3b2a",
  "name": "my-bot",
  "status": "created",
  "phone": null,
  "pushName": null,
  "connectedAt": null,
  "lastActive": null,
  "createdAt": "2026-06-25T09:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-06-25T09:00:00.000Z",
  "lastError": null,
  "engineLoaded": false
}
```

Like every other session route, this returns the `SessionResponseDto` shape (via `fromEntity`), so `config`/`proxyUrl`/`proxyType` are stripped and `lastActiveAt` appears as `lastActive`. Newly created `status` is `created`.

**Errors:** `400` validation (bad `name`/`proxyUrl`/`proxyType`, or an extra non-whitelisted field) · `401` · `403` key lacks OPERATOR role · `409` session name already exists

#### POST /api/sessions/:id/start

Start a session and initialize the WhatsApp connection.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)  ·  **Scope:** session-scoped

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Session UUID |

No request body.

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "id": "8f3c2b1a-9d4e-4c7a-8b2f-1e6d5a4c3b2a",
  "name": "my-bot",
  "status": "initializing",
  "phone": null,
  "pushName": null,
  "connectedAt": null,
  "lastActive": null,
  "createdAt": "2026-06-20T11:30:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-06-25T09:05:00.000Z",
  "lastError": null,
  "engineLoaded": true
}
```

Returned via `transformSession`. Status typically transitions to `initializing` / `qr_ready`.

**Errors:** `400` session already started / already starting · `401` · `403` · `404` not found · `409` credential teardown for the same session name still in flight (retryable; body carries `code: 'SESSION_NAME_TEARDOWN_PENDING'`; no destructive side effect runs before the refusal — a retry after cleanup settles proceeds)

#### POST /api/sessions/:id/stop

Stop a session and disconnect WhatsApp.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)  ·  **Scope:** session-scoped

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Session UUID |

No request body.

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "id": "8f3c2b1a-9d4e-4c7a-8b2f-1e6d5a4c3b2a",
  "name": "my-bot",
  "status": "disconnected",
  "phone": "6281234567890",
  "pushName": "My Bot",
  "connectedAt": null,
  "lastActive": "2026-06-25T09:01:55.000Z",
  "createdAt": "2026-06-20T11:30:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-06-25T09:10:00.000Z",
  "lastError": null,
  "engineLoaded": false
}
```

Returned via `transformSession`; status typically becomes `disconnected`.

**Errors:** `401` · `403` · `404` not found

#### POST /api/sessions/:id/logout

Attempt an engine-native unlink of this companion device, then tear the session down locally.

`stop` disconnects while keeping the stored credentials, and `delete` additionally purges the
on-disk auth directories and the session row, but neither tells WhatsApp anything: the device stays
listed under the account holder's **Linked Devices** on the phone until they remove it by hand.
`logout` attempts the engine-native unlink operation itself.

A `200` means the engine-native unlink operation **and** the required local credential cleanup both
completed — for Baileys, a valid companion identity, an acknowledged `remove-companion-device` IQ
response, and removal of the on-disk auth dir; for whatsapp-web.js, the native `Client.logout()`
promise (including `LocalAuth.logout()`) settled. `200` is **not** an independent observation that
the handset UI no longer shows the linked device — only the linked device itself can observe that,
and callers must not claim otherwise. Because a completed unlink wipes the stored credentials, a
later `start` always requires a fresh QR scan or pairing code.

The session must be running — the unlink is a network round-trip that needs a live engine, so a
stopped session is rejected with `400` (the row is left untouched) rather than reported as a success
that never reached WhatsApp.

If the engine-backed logout attempt does not complete, the session is still torn down locally
(map reconciled, status `disconnected`) but the route returns `502` with a stable
`code: 'SESSION_LOGOUT_INCOMPLETE'`: no send / no acknowledgement / timeout or transport error / or
a local-cleanup failure. `phone` is cleared on this path and **no** `session_logged_out` audit row
is written (that audit is only written on the `200` path). Start the session again and retry the
logout. Do not assume the retry reconnects automatically or lands in a guaranteed QR state — whether
the old credentials remain usable depends on where the failure happened, and the route does not
report which.

With `AUTO_START_SESSIONS=true`, auto-start selects sessions whose `phone` is non-null. Both a `200`
and a `502` logout clear `phone`, so neither is auto-started on boot — an incomplete-logout (`502`)
session must be started explicitly and the logout retried by hand. A session that must stay down can
simply be left as-is.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)  ·  **Scope:** session-scoped

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Session UUID |

No request body.

**Response** `200`

Returned via `transformSession`; status becomes `disconnected` and `phone` is cleared (so the boot
auto-start does not resurrect the session). Recorded in the audit log as `session_logged_out`,
distinguishing an intentional unlink from a plain stop.

**Errors:** `400` session is not started (no engine to send through; the row is left untouched) · `401` · `403` · `404` not found · `502` `SESSION_LOGOUT_INCOMPLETE` — session stopped locally but the logout operation did not complete (retryable; `phone` cleared, no success audit)

Delete a session.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)  ·  **Scope:** session-scoped

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Session UUID |

**Response** `204` — empty body (`@HttpCode(204)`, returns void). A `findOne` lookup runs first, so a missing id yields `404`.

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid key, or key not scoped to this session · `403` key role below OPERATOR · `404` session not found · `409` credential teardown for the same session name still in flight (retryable; body carries `code: 'SESSION_NAME_TEARDOWN_PENDING'`; on a `409` the row is **not** deleted and no hook/auth-purge runs — retry after cleanup settles)

### 6.4.2 Messages

All routes are mounted under `/api/sessions/:sessionId/messages`. Reads (`GET` history, batch status, reactions) accept any valid API key (including VIEWER). All write/send routes require **API key (OPERATOR)** or higher. Single-recipient send routes return `MessageResponseDto { messageId, timestamp }` (`timestamp` is an epoch **number** in seconds; there is no `status` field); `POST send-bulk` instead returns `202` with `BulkMessageResponseDto`. The global ValidationPipe runs `whitelist` + `forbidNonWhitelisted`, so any body field not listed below is rejected with `400`.

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/messages

Get persisted message history for a session from the local DB (paginated, filterable). Reads the DB only — does not hit WhatsApp.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID |

**Query parameters**

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| chatId | string | No | — | Filter by chat ID. Matched across `@c.us` / `@s.whatsapp.net` dialects via the lid-mapping table. |
| from | string | No | — | Filter by sender. A phone also matches any lid that resolves to it. |
| limit | integer | No | 50 | Clamped to `[1,100]`; a non-finite value falls back to 50. |
| offset | integer | No | 0 | Clamped to `>=0`; a non-finite value falls back to 0. |

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "id": "9f1c2e7a-2b3d-4c5e-8a91-0d1e2f3a4b5c",
      "sessionId": "my-session",
      "waMessageId": "true_628123456789@c.us_3EB0ABCD",
      "chatId": "628123456789@c.us",
      "from": "628123456789@c.us",
      "to": "628987654321@c.us",
      "body": "Hello from OpenWA!",
      "type": "text",
      "direction": "outgoing",

      "createdAt": "2026-06-25T09:20:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "total": 1
}
```

Each `Message`: `{ id (uuid), sessionId, waMessageId (string|null), chatId, from, to, body (string|null), type, direction ('incoming'|'outgoing'), timestamp (number|null), metadata (object|null), status ('pending'|'sent'|'delivered'|'read'|'failed'), createdAt (ISO date) }`. Ordered by `createdAt` DESC. The response is the raw service object (no envelope). Unlike the live `IncomingMessage` shape below, this persisted `Message` does **not** carry `kind` — re-derive the chat kind from `chatId` (see `ChatKind` / `chatKind()`) if needed.

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid API key

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/messages/:chatId/history

Fetch chat history live from WhatsApp for a chat, bypassing the local DB.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID |
| chatId | string | Chat ID, e.g. `628123456789@c.us` or `groupId@g.us` |

**Query parameters**

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| limit | integer | No | 50 | Clamped to `[1,100]`; when `deep=true` the ceiling rises to 2000. Non-finite falls back to 50. |
| includeMedia | boolean | No | false | Truthy only for `true` or `1`. Downloads base64 media (slower). Forced OFF when `deep=true`. |
| deep | boolean | No | false | Truthy only for `true` or `1`. Raises the limit ceiling 100→2000 (whatsapp-web.js only) and forces metadata-only. |

**Response** `200`

Returns a bare array of engine-neutral `IncomingMessage` objects:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "true_628123456789@c.us_3EB0ABCD",
    "from": "628123456789@c.us",
    "to": "628987654321@c.us",
    "chatId": "628123456789@c.us",
    "body": "Hi there",
    "type": "text",
    "timestamp": 1719312000,
    "fromMe": false,
    "isGroup": false,
    "kind": "individual",
    "author": "628123456789@c.us",
    "senderPhone": "628123456789"
  }
]
```

Each item may also include `isStatusBroadcast`, `mentionedIds`, `isLidSender`, `contact`, `media { mimetype, filename?, data?, omitted?, sizeBytes? }`, `quotedMessage { id, body }`, `call { video, missed }` (for `call` messages), and `location { latitude, longitude, description?, address?, url? }`. `type` is one of `text|image|video|audio|voice|document|sticker|location|contact|call|revoked|masked|unknown`. A `masked` message is one WhatsApp deliberately withholds from linked/companion devices — e.g. a high-security business OTP — so its `body` is empty by design (the content is only available on the primary phone) rather than a parsing failure; this occurs on the Baileys engine. `kind` is the user-facing chat discriminator of `chatId` — one of `individual|group|channel|status|broadcast|unknown`; it supersedes `isStatusBroadcast` (equivalent to `kind === 'status'`), which is retained for back-compat.

**Errors:** `400` session not active · `401` missing/invalid API key · `500` engine error

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/messages/:chatId/:messageId/reactions

Get reactions for a specific message, grouped by emoji with the senders.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

**Response** `200`

Returns a bare array of `MessageReaction`:

```json
[
  {
    "emoji": "👍",
    "senders": [
      { "senderId": "628123456789@c.us", "emoji": "👍", "timestamp": 1719312050 }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Errors:** `400` session not active · `401` missing/invalid API key · `500` engine error

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/messages/batch/:batchId

Get the processing status and progress of a bulk batch.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "batchId": "batch_a1b2c3d4",
  "status": "processing",
  "progress": { "total": 2, "sent": 1, "failed": 0, "pending": 1, "cancelled": 0 },

  ],
  "startedAt": "2026-06-25T09:20:55.000Z",
  "completedAt": null
}
```

`status` is one of `pending|processing|completed|cancelled|failed`; per-result `status` is `pending|sent|failed|cancelled`. A failed result carries a sanitized `error { code, message }` (internals are not leaked).

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid API key · `404` batch not found for this session

```

`messageId` is the WhatsApp message id from the engine. An optional `SIMULATE_TYPING` humanising pause may run before send.

**Errors:** `400` unknown body field, validation failure, or session not active / blocked by a plugin hook · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key role below OPERATOR · `404` session not found · `500` engine error

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/messages/send-video

Send a video (by URL or base64) with an optional caption. Uses the same `SendMediaMessageDto` (and the same validation rules and errors) as `send-image`.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID |

**Request body** — `SendMediaMessageDto` (fields `chatId`, `url`, `base64`, `mimetype`, `filename`, `caption` — see `send-image`)

**Errors:** `400` media validation failure / session not active / unknown body field · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key role below OPERATOR · `500` engine error

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/messages/send-audio

Send an audio message (by URL or base64). Uses `SendAudioMessageDto`. A `caption` is accepted by the DTO but not persisted for audio. Set `ptt: true` to send a real WhatsApp **voice note** (microphone bubble + waveform) instead of a plain audio file. `ptt` is a JSON boolean, exclusive to this endpoint, and — because voice notes require `audio/ogg; codecs=opus` — the server defaults the mimetype to that when you set `ptt` without one; for reliable playback (especially on the Baileys engine, which does not transcode) supply OGG/Opus bytes. A `ptt` voice note is stored as message `type: "voice"`.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID |

**Request body** — `SendAudioMessageDto` (all `SendMediaMessageDto` fields — `chatId`, `url`, `base64`, `mimetype`, `filename`, `caption` — plus optional `ptt` boolean)

```json
{ "chatId": "628123456789@c.us", "url": "https://example.com/voice.ogg", "mimetype": "audio/ogg", "ptt": true }
```

**Response** `201`

```json
{ "messageId": "true_628123456789@c.us_3EB0ABCD", "timestamp": 1719312000 }
```

**Errors:** `400` media validation failure / session not active / unknown body field · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key role below OPERATOR · `500` engine error

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/messages/send-document

Send a document/file (by URL or base64). Uses `SendMediaMessageDto`; `filename` is used as the persisted body fallback.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID |

**Request body** — `SendMediaMessageDto` (fields `chatId`, `url`, `base64`, `mimetype`, `filename`, `caption` — see `send-image`)

```json
{ "chatId": "628123456789@c.us", "url": "https://example.com/report.pdf", "filename": "report.pdf", "mimetype": "application/pdf" }
```

**Response** `201`

```json
{ "messageId": "true_628123456789@c.us_3EB0ABCD", "timestamp": 1719312000 }
```

**Engine differences:** Baileys always sends a document as a document, while whatsapp-web.js deliberately keeps normal mimetype classification for `status@broadcast` and broadcast lists — the library returns `null` for document-mode sends to those recipients, so forcing the flag there would turn a working send into a failure. For URL-based sends without an explicit `filename`, whatsapp-web.js derives the URL basename; Baileys falls back to the literal `file`.

**Errors:** `400` media validation failure / session not active / unknown body field · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key role below OPERATOR · `500` engine error

**Errors:** `400` session not active / unknown body field · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key role below OPERATOR · `404` message not found · `500` engine error (e.g. editing another account's message, which WhatsApp forbids)

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/messages/send-bulk

Send messages to multiple recipients as an async batch — returns immediately and processes in the background.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID |

**Request body** — `SendBulkMessageDto`

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| batchId | string | No | string | Auto-generated `batch_<hex>` if omitted; a duplicate id returns `400` |
| messages | BulkMessageItemDto[] | Yes | array, max 100, nested-validated | The batch items (see below); duplicate `chatId`s are collapsed before processing — first occurrence wins, order preserved |
| options | BulkMessageOptionsDto | No | nested-validated | Pacing/error options (see below) |

Each `BulkMessageItemDto`: `{ chatId: string, type: 'text'|'image'|'video'|'audio'|'document', content: BulkMessageContentDto, variables?: Record<string,string> }`. `content` (all fields optional, nested-validated): `text?: string`, `image?`/`video?`/`audio?`/`document?`: `{ url?, base64?, mimetype?, filename? }`, `caption?: string`.

`BulkMessageOptionsDto`: `{ delayBetweenMessages?: number (1000–60000, default 3000), randomizeDelay?: boolean (default true), stopOnError?: boolean (default false) }`.

Each item's base64 media is checked against the media byte cap (`MEDIA_DOWNLOAD_MAX_BYTES`) twice: at batch creation, and again per item after `variables` and the `message:sending` plugin gate are applied. An item that outgrows the cap only after rendering fails individually (`failed` in `results`, with `message:failed` fired) instead of being sent. `totalMessages` in the response reflects the de-duplicated item count.

```json
{
  "messages": [
    { "chatId": "628111111111@c.us", "type": "text", "content": { "text": "Hi {{name}}" }, "variables": { "name": "Alice" } },
    { "chatId": "628222222222@c.us", "type": "image", "content": { "image": { "url": "https://example.com/promo.jpg" }, "caption": "Promo" } }
  ],
  "options": { "delayBetweenMessages": 3000, "randomizeDelay": true, "stopOnError": false }
}
```

**Response** `202`

`202 Accepted` (via `@HttpCode`). `statusUrl` points at the batch-status route below.

```json
{
  "batchId": "batch_a1b2c3d4",
  "status": "pending",
  "totalMessages": 2,
  "estimatedCompletionTime": "2026-06-25T09:21:00.000Z",
  "statusUrl": "/api/sessions/my-session/messages/batch/batch_a1b2c3d4"
}
```

**Errors:** `400` session not active, duplicate `batchId`, base64 over media cap, or DTO/nested validation failure (unknown nested field rejected) · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key role below OPERATOR · `500` engine error

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/messages/batch/:batchId/cancel

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

**Response** `200`

`200` via `@HttpCode`. On cancel, the remaining pending count is moved to `cancelled`.

```json
{
  "batchId": "batch_a1b2c3d4",
  "status": "cancelled",
  "progress": { "total": 2, "sent": 1, "failed": 0, "pending": 0, "cancelled": 1 }
}
```

**Errors:** `400` batch already completed or cancelled · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key role below OPERATOR · `404` batch not found

### 6.4.3 Contacts

Contact endpoints are scoped under a session: `/api/sessions/:sessionId/contacts`. All read routes require a valid API key; the block/unblock writes require an `OPERATOR` key. Every route returns `400 "Session is not started"` when the target session exists but is not in a started/ready state, and `404` when the session itself does not exist. Responses are the raw handler payload (no envelope).

The `Contact` object returned by the list and get-by-id routes has this shape:

```json
{
  "id": "6281234567890@c.us",
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "pushName": "Jane",
  "number": "6281234567890",
  "isMyContact": true,
  "isBlocked": false,
  "profilePicUrl": "https://pps.whatsapp.net/v/..."
}
```

`name`, `pushName`, and `profilePicUrl` are optional and may be absent.

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/contacts

List all contacts for a session, returned as an in-memory paginated window.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID. |

**Query parameters**

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| limit | integer | No | 1000 | Parsed with `parseInt(…,10)`; clamped to `[1, 1000]`. Omitted or non-finite values fall back to 1000. |
| offset | integer | No | 0 | Parsed with `parseInt(…,10)`; non-finite values fall back to 0, then truncated to `>= 0`. |

**Response** `200` — bare `Contact[]` array

```json
[
  {
    "id": "6281234567890@c.us",
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "pushName": "Jane",
    "number": "6281234567890",
    "isMyContact": true,
    "isBlocked": false,
    "profilePicUrl": "https://pps.whatsapp.net/v/..."
  }
]
```

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid API key, or key not scoped to this session

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/contacts/check/:number

Check whether a phone number exists on WhatsApp and return its canonical WhatsApp id when it does.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID. |
| number | string | Phone number to check, e.g. `628123456789` (digits, no `@c.us` suffix). |

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "number": "628123456789",
  "exists": true,
  "whatsappId": "628123456789@c.us"
}
```

`whatsappId` is the canonical native chat id, or `null` when the number is not on WhatsApp; `exists` is `whatsappId !== null`.

> Route-order caveat: this route is two path segments (`check/:number`), so it never collides with the single-segment `GET /:contactId` — a contact id of literally `check` resolves to `GET /:contactId`.

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid API key

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/contacts/:contactId

Get a single contact by its WhatsApp id.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID. |
| contactId | string | Contact id / JID, e.g. `6281234567890@c.us` or an `@lid`. |

**Response** `200` — `Contact`

```json
{
  "id": "6281234567890@c.us",
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "pushName": "Jane",
  "number": "6281234567890",
  "isMyContact": true,
  "isBlocked": false,
  "profilePicUrl": "https://pps.whatsapp.net/v/..."
}
```

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid API key · `404` `Contact <id> not found` (engine returned null)

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/contacts/:contactId/profile-picture

Get the profile picture URL for a contact (best-effort).

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID. |
| contactId | string | Contact id / JID, e.g. `6281234567890@c.us`. |

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "url": "https://pps.whatsapp.net/v/..." }
```

`url` is `null` when there is no picture, the contact's privacy hides it, or it cannot be resolved.

> The path segment is `profile-picture` (hyphenated), not `profile-pic`.

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid API key

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/contacts/profile-pictures

Batch-resolve profile picture URLs for many contacts in one request (a chat sidebar would otherwise fire a burst of single fetches and exhaust the per-IP throttle).

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID. |

**Query parameters**

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ids | string | Yes | Comma-separated contact ids. Blank entries are dropped; only the **first 50** ids are looked up, the rest are ignored (they simply do not appear in the response). |

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "pictures": {
    "6281234567890@c.us": "https://pps.whatsapp.net/v/...",
    "6289876543210@c.us": null
  }
}
```

`pictures` is keyed by the requested id. A per-id failure — or a lookup that exceeds the 8 s per-id deadline — yields `null` for that id rather than failing the batch. An omitted or empty `ids` returns `{ "pictures": {} }`.

> Route-order caveat: `profile-pictures` is declared **before** `GET /:contactId`, so the literal segment wins — a contact whose id is literally `profile-pictures` cannot be fetched through the single-contact route.

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid API key, or key not scoped to this session

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/contacts/:contactId/phone

Resolve a contact id (e.g. an `@lid`) to a phone number (MSISDN digits), best-effort.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID. |
| contactId | string | Contact id / JID to resolve, e.g. an `@lid`. |

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "contactId": "12345678901234@lid", "phone": "6281234567890" }
```

`phone` is `null` when the engine cannot map the id (e.g. an `@lid` the account has never seen).

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid API key

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/contacts/:contactId/block

Block a contact.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID. |
| contactId | string | Contact id / JID, e.g. `6281234567890@c.us`. |

This route takes no request body and binds no DTO. Send an empty body `{}` (the global `whitelist` + `forbidNonWhitelisted` ValidationPipe rejects any unexpected field with `400`).

**Response** `200`

This route is annotated `@HttpCode(200)`, so it returns `200` rather than the POST default `201`.

```json
{ "success": true, "message": "Contact blocked" }
```

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key role below OPERATOR

#### DELETE /api/sessions/:sessionId/contacts/:contactId/block

Unblock a contact.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID. |
| contactId | string | Contact id / JID, e.g. `6281234567890@c.us`. |

No request body.

**Response** `200`

No `@HttpCode` override is present, so this DELETE returns the NestJS default `200` (not `204`).

```json
{ "success": true, "message": "Contact unblocked" }
```

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key role below OPERATOR

### 6.4.4 Groups

All group routes are nested under a session: base path `/api/sessions/:sessionId/groups`. Reads (`GET`) require a plain API key; writes (create/modify/leave/revoke) require an `OPERATOR` role key. All routes resolve the engine for the session first, so a session that is not started yields `400 Session is not started`.

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/groups

List all groups for a session, with pagination.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID |

**Query parameters**

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| limit | string (parsed base-10 to number) | No | 1000 | Max groups to return; clamped to [1, 1000]. Omitted/non-finite → 1000. |
| offset | string (parsed base-10 to number) | No | 0 | Groups to skip. Non-finite → 0; negative truncated to 0. |

**Response** `200`

Raw array (no envelope). The service calls `engine.getGroups()`, projects each entry down to `id`/`name`/`linkedParentJID`, then paginates to bound the window. Anything else the engine's group object may carry is dropped by that projection — use `GET /groups/:groupId` (participants, settings, owner) when you need more than the identity.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "120363021234567890@g.us",
    "name": "Project Team",
    "linkedParentJID": null
  }
]
```

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key`

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/groups/:groupId

Get detailed group info including participants.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID |
| groupId | string | Group ID, e.g. `120363021234567890@g.us` |

**Response** `200`

Raw object (no envelope). `engine.getGroupInfo()` returns `GroupInfo | null`; the service throws `404` when it is `null`.

```json
{
  "id": "120363021234567890@g.us",
  "name": "Project Team",
  "description": "Internal coordination group.",
  "owner": "628123456789@c.us",
  "createdAt": 1718900000,
  "isReadOnly": false,
  "isAnnounce": false,
  "linkedParentJID": null,
  "participants": [
    {
      "id": "628123456789@c.us",
      "number": "628123456789",
      "name": "Alice",
      "isAdmin": true,
      "isSuperAdmin": true
    }
  ]
}
```

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `404` `Group <groupId> not found`

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/groups/:groupId/invite-code

Get the group invite code and full invite link.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID |
| groupId | string | Group ID |

**Response** `200`

`inviteCode` comes from `engine.getGroupInviteCode()`; `inviteLink` is `https://chat.whatsapp.com/<inviteCode>`.

```json
{
  "inviteCode": "AbCdEf123456",
  "inviteLink": "https://chat.whatsapp.com/AbCdEf123456"
}
```

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key`

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/groups

Create a new group with an initial set of participants.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID |

**Request body** — `CreateGroupDto`

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| name | string | Yes | `@IsString`, `@IsNotEmpty` | Group subject/name |
| participants | string[] | Yes | `@IsArray`, `@ArrayNotEmpty`, `@IsString({each:true})` | Non-empty array of WhatsApp IDs, e.g. `628123456789@c.us` |

```json
{
  "name": "Project Team",
  "participants": ["628123456789@c.us", "628987654321@c.us"]
}
```

**Response** `201`

Returns the created `Group` directly (raw).

```json
{
  "id": "120363021234567890@g.us",
  "name": "Project Team",
  "participantsCount": 3,
  "isAdmin": true,
  "linkedParentJID": null
}
```

**Errors:** `400` validation (missing/empty `name` or `participants`, or any non-DTO field) / session not started · `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` key lacks OPERATOR role

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/groups/:groupId/participants

Add participants to a group.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID |
| groupId | string | Group ID |

**Request body** — `ParticipantsDto`

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| participants | string[] | Yes | `@IsArray`, `@ArrayNotEmpty`, `@IsString({each:true})` | Non-empty array of WhatsApp IDs |

```json
{ "participants": ["628123456789@c.us"] }
```

**Response** `200`

Status is forced to `200` via `@HttpCode(HttpStatus.OK)` (overriding the POST default). `results` carries the engine's per-participant outcome — a partial refusal does **not** fail the batch, so check `results[].success` rather than the envelope's `success`.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Participants added",
  "results": [
    { "id": "628123456789@c.us", "success": true, "status": 200 },
    { "id": "628987654321@c.us", "success": false, "status": 403, "message": "invite-only" }
  ]
}
```

Each entry is a `ParticipantOperationResult`: `id` (the participant the outcome belongs to), `success` (true only when the engine confirmed the change for that participant), and the optional engine-reported `status`/`message` (e.g. `200` ok, `403` invite-only/not-admin, `404` not registered, `409` already a member). Engines that only confirm the batch as a whole report one success entry per requested participant.

**Errors:** `400` validation / session not started · `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` key lacks OPERATOR role

#### DELETE /api/sessions/:sessionId/groups/:groupId/participants

### 6.4.5 Message Templates

Reusable message templates scoped to a session, with `{{variable}}` placeholders rendered at send time. All routes are nested under `/api/sessions/:sessionId/templates` and require an **OPERATOR** key. The `sessionId` is stored on the template but is **not** validated against an existing session in these handlers.

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/templates

List all templates for a session, newest first.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID; filters templates by `sessionId`. |

**Response** `200`

Bare `Template[]` array (no pagination, no envelope). Ordered by `createdAt` DESC. Returns an empty array — not `404` — when the session has no templates.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "f1c2a3b4-5d6e-7f80-9a1b-2c3d4e5f6071",
    "sessionId": "9b1c0e2a-3d4f-5a6b-7c8d-9e0f1a2b3c4d",
    "name": "order-confirmation",
    "body": "Hi {{customer}}, your order {{orderId}} has shipped.",
    "header": "OpenWA Store",
    "footer": "Reply STOP to unsubscribe.",
    "createdAt": "2026-06-25T10:15:00.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2026-06-25T10:15:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` key below OPERATOR role

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/templates/:id

Get a single template by ID within the session.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID; combined with `id` in the lookup. |
| id | string | Template UUID. |

**Response** `200`

Raw `Template` entity (no envelope).

```json
{
  "id": "f1c2a3b4-5d6e-7f80-9a1b-2c3d4e5f6071",
  "sessionId": "9b1c0e2a-3d4f-5a6b-7c8d-9e0f1a2b3c4d",
  "name": "order-confirmation",
  "body": "Hi {{customer}}, your order {{orderId}} has shipped.",
  "header": "OpenWA Store",
  "footer": "Reply STOP to unsubscribe.",
  "createdAt": "2026-06-25T10:15:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-06-25T10:15:00.000Z"
}
```

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` key below OPERATOR role · `404` no row matches the `id`+`sessionId` pair (`{ "statusCode": 404, "message": "Template with id '<id>' not found", "error": "Not Found" }`)

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/templates

Create a message template for the session (with `{{variable}}` placeholders in the body).

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID; stored as `template.sessionId`. Not validated against an existing session in this handler. |

**Request body** — `CreateTemplateDto`

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| name | string | yes | non-empty, max 100 chars | Unique template name within the session (DB unique index on `[sessionId, name]`). Duplicate → `409`. |
| body | string | yes | non-empty, max 4096 chars | Template body containing `{{variable}}` placeholders rendered at send time. |
| header | string | no | max 1024 chars | Optional header text; coerced to `null` when omitted. Prepended to rendered body. |
| footer | string | no | max 1024 chars | Optional footer text; coerced to `null` when omitted. Appended to rendered body. |

```json
{
  "name": "order-confirmation",
  "body": "Hi {{customer}}, your order {{orderId}} has shipped.",
  "header": "OpenWA Store",
  "footer": "Reply STOP to unsubscribe."
}
```

**Response** `201`

Returns the saved `Template` entity raw (no envelope). The lazy `session` relation is not loaded on a freshly saved entity, so it is absent from the JSON.

```json
{
  "id": "f1c2a3b4-5d6e-7f80-9a1b-2c3d4e5f6071",
  "sessionId": "9b1c0e2a-3d4f-5a6b-7c8d-9e0f1a2b3c4d",
  "name": "order-confirmation",
  "body": "Hi {{customer}}, your order {{orderId}} has shipped.",
  "header": "OpenWA Store",
  "footer": "Reply STOP to unsubscribe.",
  "createdAt": "2026-06-25T10:15:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-06-25T10:15:00.000Z"
}
```

**Errors:** `400` validation failure (missing/empty `name`/`body`, over-length, or any extra field rejected by `forbidNonWhitelisted`) · `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` key below OPERATOR role · `409` duplicate `name` for the session

#### PUT /api/sessions/:sessionId/templates/:id

Update a template's name/body/header/footer (partial; only provided fields change).

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID. |
| id | string | Template UUID to update. |

**Request body** — `UpdateTemplateDto`

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| name | string | no | if present: non-empty, max 100 chars | Applied only when not `undefined`. Duplicate name → `409`. |
| body | string | no | if present: non-empty, max 4096 chars | Applied only when not `undefined`. |
| header | string | no | max 1024 chars | Applied only when not `undefined`. The update path does **not** coerce to `null`, so passing explicit `null` fails `@IsString`; omit the key to leave it unchanged. |
| footer | string | no | max 1024 chars | Applied only when not `undefined`. |

```json
{
  "body": "Hi {{customer}}, your order {{orderId}} is out for delivery.",
  "footer": "Thanks for shopping with us."
}
```

**Response** `200`

Loads via lookup (`404` if missing), patches the provided fields, saves, and returns the updated entity raw. `updatedAt` is refreshed.

```json
{
  "id": "f1c2a3b4-5d6e-7f80-9a1b-2c3d4e5f6071",
  "sessionId": "9b1c0e2a-3d4f-5a6b-7c8d-9e0f1a2b3c4d",
  "name": "order-confirmation",
  "body": "Hi {{customer}}, your order {{orderId}} is out for delivery.",
  "header": "OpenWA Store",
  "footer": "Thanks for shopping with us.",
  "createdAt": "2026-06-25T10:15:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-06-25T11:02:00.000Z"
}
```

**Errors:** `400` validation / `forbidNonWhitelisted` · `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` key below OPERATOR role · `404` `id`+`sessionId` not found (raised before any write) · `409` rename collides with another template name in the session

#### DELETE /api/sessions/:sessionId/templates/:id

Delete a template by ID.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID. |
| id | string | Template UUID to delete. |

**Response** `204`

No content (empty body). The handler looks the template up first, so a missing template yields `404` rather than a silent `204`.

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` key below OPERATOR role · `404` `id`+`sessionId` not found

### 6.4.6 Catalog & Channels

WhatsApp Business catalog browsing/sending and channel (newsletter) operations. Catalog read routes (`/catalog…`) require any valid API key; the two product/catalog **send** routes live under the `/messages` path and require an **OPERATOR** key. Channel read routes require any valid API key; subscribe/unsubscribe require **OPERATOR**.

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/catalog

Get business catalog info for the session's WhatsApp Business account.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sessionId` | string | WhatsApp session id. |

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "id": "1234567890123456",
  "name": "My Storefront",
  "description": "Best products in town",
  "productCount": 12,
  "url": "https://wa.me/c/6281234567890"
}
```

**Not implemented on any engine.** Both adapters throw `EngineNotSupportedError` (`501`) — whatsapp-web.js has no native Catalog API (the former null-returning stub was removed), and Baileys leaves it unwired. The shape above documents the contract, not a response you can obtain today. The whatsapp-web.js adapter calls its readiness guard *before* refusing, so a session that exists but is not `READY` (initializing, waiting on a QR, reconnecting) gets `409` instead of `501`; Baileys refuses unconditionally.

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid API key · `404` `Session <sessionId> not found or not connected` · `409` session present but not READY (whatsapp-web.js only) · `501` not implemented on either engine

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/catalog/products

List catalog products with pagination.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sessionId` | string | WhatsApp session id. |

**Query parameters**

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `page` | integer | No | `1` | Page number. Coerced from string; must be an integer `>= 1` or `400`. |
| `limit` | integer | No | `20` | Page size. Must be an integer `>= 1`. No upper cap declared on the DTO. |

Validated against `ProductQueryDto` via the global ValidationPipe; any unknown query key is rejected with `400` (forbidNonWhitelisted).

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "products": [
    {
      "id": "PROD_12345",

    }
  ],
  "pagination": { "page": 1, "limit": 20, "total": 1, "totalPages": 1 }
}
```

**Not implemented on any engine.** Both adapters throw `EngineNotSupportedError` (`501`), so the shape above documents the contract, not a response you can obtain today. Query validation still runs first, so a bad `page`/`limit` is a `400`. On whatsapp-web.js the readiness guard runs before the refusal, so a session that exists but is not `READY` gets `409` instead of `501`; Baileys refuses unconditionally.

**Errors:** `400` invalid `page`/`limit` or unknown query key · `401` missing/invalid API key · `404` `Session <sessionId> not found or not connected` · `409` session present but not READY (whatsapp-web.js only) · `501` not implemented on either engine

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/messages/send-product

Send a product message (catalog product card) to a chat. Note: this route lives under the `/messages` path but belongs to the catalog module.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sessionId` | string | WhatsApp session id. |

**Request body** — `SendProductDto`

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `chatId` | string | Yes | `@IsString` | Target chat/recipient id (e.g. `6281234567890@c.us`). |

```json
{
  "chatId": "6281234567890@c.us",
  "productId": "PROD_12345",
  "body": "Check out this item!"
}
```

**Response** `501` (not implemented on either engine)

```json
{
  "statusCode": 501,
  "message": "Operation not supported by the active engine: sendProduct",
  "error": "Not Implemented"
}
```

No engine implements this. whatsapp-web.js and Baileys both raise `EngineNotSupportedError`, so the
route cannot return a success body on any deployment; it is documented here because it is mounted.
On whatsapp-web.js the readiness guard runs before the refusal, so a session that exists but is not
`READY` gets `409` instead of `501`; Baileys refuses unconditionally.

**Errors:** `400` missing `chatId`/`productId`, wrong types, or any field not on the DTO · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` API-key role below OPERATOR · `404` `Session <sessionId> not found or not connected` · `409` session present but not READY (whatsapp-web.js only) · `500` engine error

}
```

**Errors:** `400` `Session is not started` · `401` missing/invalid API key · `404` `Channel <channelId> not found` (engine returned null)

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/channels/:channelId/messages

Get recent messages from a channel/newsletter.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |

| `limit` | number | No | engine default (Swagger notes 50) | Max messages to return. Taken as a raw query string and run through `parseInt(limit, 10)` when present. There is **no** DTO/ValidationPipe on this value, but a non-numeric `limit` (e.g. `?limit=abc`) parses to `NaN` and falls back to `undefined`, i.e. the engine default — it is never forwarded as `NaN`. |

**Response** `200`

```json
[
  {
    "id": "false_120363000000000000@newsletter_3EB0...",
    "body": "v0.7.3 is out!",
    "timestamp": 1719331200,
    "hasMedia": false,
    "mediaUrl": null
  }

```

Bare array. `timestamp` is an epoch number (seconds).

**Errors:** `400` `Session is not started` · `401` missing/invalid API key

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/channels/subscribe

Subscribe to a channel using its invite code.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sessionId` | string | WhatsApp session id. Engine must be started. |

**Request body** — `SubscribeChannelDto`

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `inviteCode` | string | Yes | `@IsString` `@IsNotEmpty` | Channel invite code from the channel share link. |

```json
{ "inviteCode": "ABC123xyz" }

  "subscriberCount": 1042,
  "picture": "https://example.com/ch.jpg",
  "verified": true,
  "createdAt": 1717200000
}
```

**Errors:** `400` `Session is not started`, missing/empty `inviteCode`, or any unknown body field · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` API-key role below OPERATOR

#### DELETE /api/sessions/:sessionId/channels/:channelId

Unsubscribe from a channel.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sessionId` | string | WhatsApp session id. Engine must be started. |
| `channelId` | string | Channel id to unsubscribe from. |

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "success": true }
```

Note: this is the one route in the module that returns a literal `{ success: true }` (hard-coded by the controller after the void engine call resolves) rather than the raw engine return. There is no `@HttpCode` override, so it returns `200`, not `204`.

**Errors:** `400` `Session is not started` · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` API-key role below OPERATOR

### 6.4.7 Labels & Status

Labels are a WhatsApp Business feature: every label route lives under a session and reads/writes the chat-label assignments exposed by the engine. Status routes manage the session's status feed (stories) — reading visible statuses and posting/deleting your own. Read routes require a base API key; all writes require `OPERATOR`.

**Label reads are whatsapp-web.js only.** `GET /labels`, `GET /labels/:labelId` and `GET /labels/chat/:chatId` throw `501` on the Baileys engine, which exposes no label query (the library only has the association *writes*). Adding/removing a chat label works on both engines.

**Reads are store-backed, not engine-direct.** `GET /status` and `GET /status/:contactId` no longer call the engine — they read from an OpenWA-side store that ingests inbound status/story broadcasts as they arrive (plus a best-effort backfill of currently-active stories on session connect), with a 24h TTL matching WhatsApp's own story expiry. This makes reads **identical on both engines**: `whatsapp-web.js` (which had a native `getBroadcasts()`/`getBroadcastById()` path) and Baileys (which never had one — `fetchStatus` only returns the *about* text, not stories, so the raw engine methods still throw `501` if called directly, they're just no longer on the read path) now return the same shape from the same source. A status older than 24h, or received before the store existed, will not appear.

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/labels

List all labels defined for the session (WhatsApp Business accounts only).

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID |

**Response** `200`

```json
[
  { "id": "1", "name": "New customer", "hexColor": "#FF9485" },
  { "id": "5", "name": "Paid", "hexColor": "#25D366" }
]
```

Bare array — raw return of `engine.getLabels()`; no envelope.

**Errors:** `400` session is not started (no live engine), or the account is not a WhatsApp Business account · `401` missing/invalid API key · `501` the Baileys engine does not implement label reads (whatsapp-web.js only)

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/labels/:labelId

Get a single label by its ID.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID |
| labelId | string | Label ID |

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "id": "5", "name": "Paid", "hexColor": "#25D366" }
```

The engine resolves `Label | null`; a `null` is mapped to `404` in the service, so a `200` always carries a label.

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid API key · `404` `Label <labelId> not found` · `501` the Baileys engine does not implement label reads (whatsapp-web.js only)

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/labels/chat/:chatId

List the labels currently assigned to a specific chat.

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID |
| chatId | string | Chat ID (e.g. `6281234567890@c.us` or a group `…@g.us`) |

**Response** `200`

```json
[
  { "id": "5", "name": "Paid", "hexColor": "#25D366" }
]
```

Bare array — raw return of `engine.getChatLabels(chatId)`.

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid API key · `501` the Baileys engine does not implement label reads (whatsapp-web.js only)

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/labels/chat/:chatId

Add a label to a chat.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID |
| chatId | string | Chat ID to label |

**Request body** — `AddLabelDto`

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| labelId | string | yes | non-empty string | Label ID to add to the chat |

```json
{ "labelId": "5" }
```

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "success": true }
```

The handler always returns the literal `{ "success": true }`.

**Errors:** `400` validation failure (missing/empty/non-string `labelId`, or any unknown body field — strict whitelist), or session is not started · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key lacks `OPERATOR` role

#### DELETE /api/sessions/:sessionId/labels/chat/:chatId/:labelId

Remove a label from a chat.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID |
| chatId | string | Chat ID |
| labelId | string | Label ID to remove |

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "success": true }
```

The handler always returns `{ "success": true }`. DELETE default status is `200` (no `@HttpCode` override).

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key lacks `OPERATOR` role

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/status

Get all contact status updates (stories) visible to the session, read from the store (24h TTL, both engines — see the note above).

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | WhatsApp session identifier |

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "statuses": [
    {
      "id": "false_6281234567890@c.us_3A1F...",
      "contact": { "id": "6281234567890@c.us", "name": "Alice", "pushName": "Alice" },
      "type": "image",
      "caption": "On the road",
      "mediaUrl": "/api/sessions/my-session/status/false_6281234567890@c.us_3A1F.../media",
      "backgroundColor": "#25D366",
      "font": 2,
      "timestamp": "2026-06-25T08:30:00.000Z",
      "expiresAt": "2026-06-26T08:30:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

The controller wraps the store array in `{ statuses }`, ordered newest-first. `type` is one of `text | image | video`; `caption`, `backgroundColor`, `font` are optional. `mediaUrl` is present only when the status carried media that the store kept (see the media endpoint below) — it is a same-origin path into this API, not an external WhatsApp CDN link. `timestamp` and `expiresAt` serialize to ISO strings (these are `Date` values, not the epoch-number convention used by message timestamps).

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid API key, or key not scoped to this session

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/status/:contactId

Get status updates posted by a specific contact, read from the store (24h TTL, both engines).

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | WhatsApp session identifier |
| contactId | string | Contact JID/id (e.g. `6281234567890@c.us`) |

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "statuses": [
    {
      "id": "false_6281234567890@c.us_3A1F...",
      "contact": { "id": "6281234567890@c.us", "pushName": "Alice" },
      "type": "text",
      "caption": "Hello!",
      "backgroundColor": "#25D366",
      "font": 0,
      "timestamp": "2026-06-25T08:30:00.000Z",
      "expiresAt": "2026-06-26T08:30:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

Same `{ statuses }` wrapper and `Status` shape as the list-all route. An unknown `contactId` returns `{ "statuses": [] }`, not a `404`.

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid API key, or key not scoped to this session

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/status/:statusId/media

Stream a stored status's media bytes (the file behind a `mediaUrl` returned above).

**Auth:** API key

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | WhatsApp session identifier |
| statusId | string | The status `id` (e.g. from a `GET /status` response) |

**Response** `200` — the raw media bytes as the response body, with `Content-Type` set to the stored mimetype (e.g. `image/jpeg`, `video/mp4`). Streamed via `StreamableFile` from whatever backs `StorageService` (local disk or S3 — the route does not care which).

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid API key, or key not scoped to this session · `404` `Status media not found or expired` — the status is text-only, its media was omitted (e.g. over the configured size cap), or the 24h TTL has since purged the row

Note: `:statusId/media` is a two-path-segment route, so it never collides with the single-segment `GET /status/:contactId` above regardless of declaration order.

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/status/send-text

Post a text status (story) to the session's status feed. The recipients allow-list is honored on Baileys only; whatsapp-web.js broadcasts to the account's status-privacy audience.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | WhatsApp session identifier |

**Request body** — `SendTextStatusDto`

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| text | string | yes | `@MaxLength(4096)` | Status text body |
| recipients | string[] | no | 0–256 items, each matching `^\d+@(c\.us\|lid)$` | JIDs of the contacts permitted to view the status. **Honored on Baileys only** (passed as `statusJidList`), where it is required in practice — Baileys posts to exactly this allow-list, so omitting it reaches nobody. whatsapp-web.js ignores it and broadcasts to the account's status-privacy audience; omit it there |
| backgroundColor | string | no | 6-digit hex color matching `^#[0-9A-Fa-f]{6}$` | e.g. `#25D366`; bad value → `backgroundColor must be a hex color (e.g., #25D366)` |
| font | integer | no | `@IsIn([0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])` — `3`–`5` are rejected with `400` | WhatsApp status font index: `0` (default), `1`, `2`, `6` (bold), `7`, `8`, `9`, `10`. whatsapp-web.js honors only `0`–`7` and clamps anything above back to the default |

```json
{ "text": "Hello from OpenWA!", "recipients": ["6281234567890@c.us"], "backgroundColor": "#25D366", "font": 2 }
```

**Response** `201`

```json
{
  "statusId": "false_status@broadcast_3A1F...",
  "timestamp": "2026-06-25T08:30:00.000Z",
  "expiresAt": "2026-06-26T08:30:00.000Z"
}
```

Returns the engine `StatusResult` directly (no wrapper). POST default status is `201`.

**Recipient JIDs:** `@c.us` (regular phone) recipients are reliable. `@lid` (privacy-id) recipients are best-effort and unverified — WhatsApp may not deliver to an unresolved LID, so prefer `@c.us` where the phone number is known.

**Sender-side caveat:** the posting account's own phone may display a "waiting for this status update" notice in its status feed; this is cosmetic — recipients view the status normally.

**Errors:** `400` validation failure (unknown body field, a JID not matching `@c.us`/`@lid`, more than 256 recipients, `text` over 4096 chars, bad `backgroundColor`/`font`) · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key lacks `OPERATOR` role · `404` session not found / not connected

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/status/send-image

Post an image status (story) from a URL or base64 payload. The recipients allow-list is honored on Baileys only; whatsapp-web.js broadcasts to the account's status-privacy audience.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | WhatsApp session identifier |

**Request body** — `SendImageStatusDto`

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| image | object (`StatusMediaInput`) | yes | validated nested object; one of `url`/`base64` must be present — an empty `{}` is rejected with `400` | Media source wrapper |
| image.url | string | no | must be a non-empty string whenever `base64` is absent **or** `url` is present at all — `"url": ""` is rejected with `400` even when a valid `base64` is supplied | Media source URL |
| image.base64 | string | no | must be a non-empty string whenever `url` is absent **or** `base64` is present at all — `"base64": ""` is rejected with `400` even when a valid `url` is supplied | Base64-encoded media data |
| image.mimetype | string | no | — | Media MIME type; if omitted the service defaults to `image/jpeg` |
| recipients | string[] | no | 0–256 items, each matching `^\d+@(c\.us\|lid)$` | JIDs of the contacts permitted to view the status (`statusJidList`). Required in practice on Baileys (it posts to exactly this allow-list); ignored by whatsapp-web.js — omit it there |
| caption | string | no | `@MaxLength(1024)` | Optional caption |

The service resolves the media as `image.base64 || image.url || ''` — `base64` wins when both are supplied — and applies mimetype `image.mimetype ?? 'image/jpeg'`.

```json
{ "image": { "url": "https://example.com/photo.jpg", "mimetype": "image/png" }, "recipients": ["6281234567890@c.us"], "caption": "My status" }
```

**Response** `201`

```json
{
  "statusId": "false_status@broadcast_3A1F...",
  "timestamp": "2026-06-25T08:30:00.000Z",
  "expiresAt": "2026-06-26T08:30:00.000Z"
}
```

Returns the engine `StatusResult` directly. POST default status is `201`.

**Recipient JIDs:** `@c.us` (regular phone) recipients are reliable. `@lid` (privacy-id) recipients are best-effort and unverified — prefer `@c.us` where the phone number is known. **Sender-side caveat:** the posting account's own phone may show a "waiting for this status update" notice; recipients view it normally.

**Errors:** `400` validation failure (unknown body field, an empty media wrapper, a JID not matching `@c.us`/`@lid`, more than 256 recipients, or a caption over 1024 chars) · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key lacks `OPERATOR` role · `404` session not found / not connected

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/status/send-video

Post a video status (story) from a URL or base64 payload. The recipients allow-list is honored on Baileys only; whatsapp-web.js broadcasts to the account's status-privacy audience.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | WhatsApp session identifier |

**Request body** — `SendVideoStatusDto`

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| video | object (`StatusMediaInput`) | yes | validated nested object; one of `url`/`base64` must be present — an empty `{}` is rejected with `400` | Media source wrapper |
| video.url | string | no | must be a non-empty string whenever `base64` is absent **or** `url` is present at all — `"url": ""` is rejected with `400` even when a valid `base64` is supplied | Media source URL |
| video.base64 | string | no | must be a non-empty string whenever `url` is absent **or** `base64` is present at all — `"base64": ""` is rejected with `400` even when a valid `url` is supplied | Base64-encoded media data |
| video.mimetype | string | no | — | Media MIME type; if omitted the service defaults to `video/mp4` |
| recipients | string[] | no | 0–256 items, each matching `^\d+@(c\.us\|lid)$` | JIDs of the contacts permitted to view the status (`statusJidList`). Required in practice on Baileys (it posts to exactly this allow-list); ignored by whatsapp-web.js — omit it there |
| caption | string | no | `@MaxLength(1024)` | Optional caption |

The service resolves the media as `video.base64 || video.url || ''` — `base64` wins when both are supplied — and applies mimetype `video.mimetype ?? 'video/mp4'`.

```json
{ "video": { "url": "https://example.com/clip.mp4", "mimetype": "video/quicktime" }, "recipients": ["6281234567890@c.us"], "caption": "Watch this" }
```

  "timestamp": "2026-06-25T08:30:00.000Z",
  "expiresAt": "2026-06-26T08:30:00.000Z"
}
```

Returns the engine `StatusResult` directly. POST default status is `201`.

**Recipient JIDs:** `@c.us` (regular phone) recipients are reliable. `@lid` (privacy-id) recipients are best-effort and unverified — prefer `@c.us` where the phone number is known. **Sender-side caveat:** the posting account's own phone may show a "waiting for this status update" notice; recipients view it normally.

**Errors:** `400` validation failure (unknown body field, an empty media wrapper, a JID not matching `@c.us`/`@lid`, more than 256 recipients, or a caption over 1024 chars) · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key lacks `OPERATOR` role · `404` session not found / not connected

#### DELETE /api/sessions/:sessionId/status/:statusId

Delete one of the session's own posted statuses.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | WhatsApp session identifier |
| statusId | string | Id of the status to delete (the `statusId` returned by a `send-*` call) |

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "message": "Status deleted successfully" }
```

The service returns `void`; the controller returns a fixed success object. DELETE default status is `200`.

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key lacks `OPERATOR` role · `404` `Session {id} not found or not connected`

### 6.4.8 Webhooks (management)

Webhooks are configured per session and managed under `/api/sessions/:sessionId/webhooks` (handled by `WebhookController`). Two cross-session endpoints live on `WebhooksListController`: `GET /api/webhooks` (list, **OPERATOR**) and `GET /api/webhooks/delivery-failures` (dead-letter log, **ADMIN**). Every other route requires an API key with **OPERATOR** role or higher.

Two fields — `secret` and `headers` — are **write-only**: they are accepted on create/update but are **never** returned in any response (the response DTO has no `@Expose` for them, so `fromEntity` drops them). The `secret` is used to compute the `X-OpenWA-Signature: sha256=<hex>` HMAC-SHA256 header on deliveries.

The `events` array accepts these members plus the `*` wildcard: `message.received`, `message.sent`, `message.ack`, `message.failed`, `message.revoked`, `message.reaction`, `message.edited`, `session.status`, `session.qr`, `session.authenticated`, `session.disconnected`, `session.reconnect_loop`, `group.join`, `group.leave`, `group.update`, `call.received`, `status.received`. All of them are actively dispatched by the engines.

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/webhooks

List all webhooks for a session, ordered by `createdAt` descending.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID to filter webhooks by. |

**Response** `200`

```json
[
  {
    "id": "f1e2d3c4-b5a6-7890-1234-567890abcdef",
    "sessionId": "my-session",
    "url": "https://your-server.com/webhook",
    "events": ["message.received", "session.status"],
    "filters": null,
    "active": true,
    "retryCount": 3,
    "lastTriggeredAt": null,
    "createdAt": "2026-06-25T10:00:00.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2026-06-25T10:00:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

Returns a bare array; empty array if the session has no webhooks. `secret` and `headers` are never included. Not paginated.

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` insufficient role

#### GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/webhooks/:id

Get a single webhook by ID, scoped to the session.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID. The lookup is `WHERE { id, sessionId }`, so a webhook belonging to a different session resolves to `404` (no cross-session existence oracle). |
| id | string (uuid) | Webhook ID. |

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "id": "f1e2d3c4-b5a6-7890-1234-567890abcdef",
  "sessionId": "my-session",
  "url": "https://your-server.com/webhook",
  "events": ["message.received"],

#### GET /api/webhooks

List webhooks visible to the calling API key, scoped to its allowed sessions.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)  ·  **Scope:** session-scoped — derived from the authenticated key, not from any param/query

**Query parameters**

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `limit` | integer (1-1000) | No | `1000` | Max webhooks to return; oversized/non-finite values are clamped/fallback to the default window. |
| `offset` | integer | No | `0` | Webhooks to skip for paging; negative/non-finite values resolve to `0`. |

**Response** `200`

```json
[
  {
    "id": "f1e2d3c4-b5a6-7890-1234-567890abcdef",
    "sessionId": "my-session",

    "updatedAt": "2026-06-25T10:00:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

Bare array, ordered by `createdAt` descending, bounded by `limit`/`offset`. If the calling key has a non-empty `allowedSessions` list, results are filtered to `WHERE sessionId IN (allowedSessions)`; a key with null/empty `allowedSessions` (e.g. an unrestricted ADMIN key) sees **all** webhooks. This is the cross-session list; the per-session list lives at `GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/webhooks`.

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` insufficient role

#### GET /api/webhooks/delivery-failures

List webhook deliveries that exhausted every retry, most recent first. This is the dead-letter trail referenced by §6.6 — a receiver outage longer than the retry window, an over-budget payload, or a blocked (SSRF-guarded) URL lands here instead of vanishing.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)  ·  **Scope:** results are confined to the calling key's `allowedSessions`, so a session-restricted ADMIN key cannot read another session's rows via `sessionId`

**Query parameters**

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sessionId` | string | No | — | Narrow to one session. A value outside the key's `allowedSessions` returns `[]` (no cross-session existence oracle). |
| `limit` | integer (1-1000) | No | `1000` | Max records to return; oversized/non-finite values are clamped/fallback to the default window. |
| `offset` | integer | No | `0` | Records to skip for paging; negative/non-finite values resolve to `0`. |

**Response** `200`

```json

    "lastError": "Request failed with status code 502",
    "createdAt": "2026-06-25T11:59:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

Bare array of `WebhookDeliveryFailure` rows, ordered by `createdAt` descending. `lastStatusCode` is `null` when the failure was a network/timeout/SSRF error rather than a non-2xx response; `idempotencyKey`/`deliveryId` let you correlate the lost event with your own receiver logs.

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key role below ADMIN

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/webhooks

Create a webhook for the session.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session the webhook is scoped to; stored as `webhook.sessionId`. No session-existence check is performed at create time. |

**Request body** — `CreateWebhookDto`

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| url | string | yes | `@IsUrl({ require_tld: false })` (allows hostnames without a dot, e.g. `http://localhost:3000`); also run through the SSRF guard, which can reject with `400`. Entity column max 2048 chars. | Webhook URL to receive events. |
| events | string[] | no | `@IsArray`, `@ArrayMinSize(1)`, `@IsIn([...WEBHOOK_EVENTS, '*'], { each: true })` | Event names to subscribe to (see allowed set above). Defaults to `["message.received"]` when omitted. |
| secret | string | no | `@IsString`, `@MaxLength(255)` | HMAC-SHA256 signing key. **Write-only** — never returned. Used for `X-OpenWA-Signature`. Defaults to `null`. |
| headers | Record<string,string> | no | `@IsHeaderMap()` — flat object (not array), ≤50 entries, names match `/^[A-Za-z0-9-]+$/`, values are strings ≤1024 chars with no C0 control/DEL (CR/LF injection guard). | Custom headers added to deliveries. **Write-only** — never returned. At delivery, `content-type` and `x-openwa-*` names are stripped. Defaults to `{}`. |
| filters | WebhookFilters \| null | no | `@IsValidWebhookFilters()` — `{ conditions: [...] }`; each condition `{ field, operator('is'\|'isNot'\|'contains'\|'equals'), value(string\|string[]\|boolean), caseSensitive?:boolean }`; bounds: max 20 conditions, 100 values/condition, 1000-char text values. Message fields: `sender`, `recipient`, `body`, `type`, `isGroup`, `fromMe`, `hasMedia`, `mentions`. | Optional AND pre-filter; **all** conditions must match for the webhook to fire. Omit/null = fire on every subscribed event. Defaults to `null`. |
| retryCount | number (int) | no | `@IsInt`, `@Min(0)`, `@Max(5)` | Delivery retry attempts on failure. Defaults to `3`. |

}
```

`secret` and `headers` are deliberately excluded from the response. `active` defaults to `true`, `lastTriggeredAt` is `null` on create.

**Errors:** `400` validation failure, unknown body field (whitelist), SSRF URL rejection, or the per-session webhook limit (`WEBHOOK_MAX_PER_SESSION`, default 16 — delete an existing webhook before registering another; webhooks already above the cap are grandfathered and keep working) · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` insufficient role

#### PUT /api/sessions/:sessionId/webhooks/:id

Update a webhook. Partial — only fields present in the body are changed.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session scope; the webhook is looked up by `(sessionId, id)` first → `404` if not in this session. |
| id | string (uuid) | Webhook ID. |

**Request body** — `UpdateWebhookDto` (all fields optional; only fields where the value is not `undefined` are applied)

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| url | string | no | `@IsOptional`, `@IsUrl({ require_tld: false })`; re-runs the SSRF guard when provided → `400` if blocked. | New URL. |
| events | string[] | no | `@IsOptional`, `@IsArray`, `@ArrayMinSize(1)`, `@IsIn([...WEBHOOK_EVENTS, '*'], { each: true })` | Same allowed set as create (incl. `*`). |
| secret | string | no | `@IsOptional`, `@IsString`, `@MaxLength(255)` | **Write-only.** An empty string is normalized to `null`, which disables HMAC. |
| headers | Record<string,string> | no | `@IsOptional`, `@IsHeaderMap()` (same constraints as create) | **Write-only.** Replaces existing headers wholesale when provided. |
| filters | WebhookFilters \| null | no | `@IsOptional`, `@IsValidWebhookFilters()` | Set to `null` to clear filters. |
| active | boolean | no | `@IsOptional`, `@IsBoolean` | Enable/disable the webhook. (Present only on update, not create.) |
| retryCount | number (int) | no | `@IsOptional`, `@IsInt`, `@Min(0)`, `@Max(5)` | Retry attempts. |

```json
{
  "events": ["*"],
  "active": false,
  "retryCount": 5,
  "filters": null
}
```

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "id": "f1e2d3c4-b5a6-7890-1234-567890abcdef",
  "sessionId": "my-session",
  "url": "https://your-server.com/webhook",

  "updatedAt": "2026-06-25T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

Returns the saved entity; `secret` and `headers` excluded.

**Errors:** `400` validation failure, unknown body field (whitelist), or SSRF URL rejection · `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` insufficient role · `404` webhook not found in this session

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/webhooks/:id/test

Send a synthetic test payload to the webhook URL and report the result. No request body.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session scope; looked up first → `404` if not in this session. |
| id | string (uuid) | Webhook ID. |

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "success": true, "statusCode": 200 }
```

On a reachable endpoint the response is `{ success: <response.ok>, statusCode: <response.status> }` — so a non-2xx target returns `200` HTTP with `success: false` and the target's `statusCode`. On an SSRF/timeout/network error the response is `{ "success": false, "error": "<message>" }`. The endpoint never throws on delivery failure; the failure is reflected in the body, not the HTTP status. The test POST sends `{ "event": "test", ... }` with headers `Content-Type`, `User-Agent: OpenWA-Webhook/1.0.0`, `X-OpenWA-Event: test`, `X-OpenWA-Idempotency-Key`, `X-OpenWA-Delivery-Id`, `X-OpenWA-Retry-Count: 0`, and `X-OpenWA-Signature` when a secret is set. Timeout defaults to 10000 ms (`webhook.timeout` config).

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` insufficient role · `404` webhook not found in this session

#### DELETE /api/sessions/:sessionId/webhooks/:id

Delete a webhook, scoped to the session.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session scope; looked up first → `404` if not in this session. |
| id | string (uuid) | Webhook ID. |

**Response** `204`

No content (empty body; explicit `@HttpCode(204)`).

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` insufficient role · `404` webhook not found in this session

### 6.4.9 API Keys

API keys are managed under `/api/auth/api-keys`. All management routes (create/list/get/update/delete/revoke) require an **ADMIN** key **with no session scope**: the controller is fenced with `@RequireUnscopedKey`, so a key whose `allowedSessions` is non-empty is rejected with `403` whatever its role — otherwise a confined admin key could mint an unrestricted one. The guard evaluates the role requirement *before* that fence, so a scoped VIEWER/OPERATOR key is refused with `Insufficient permissions. Required: admin`; only a scoped ADMIN key reaches the fence and sees `Session-scoped API keys are not permitted on this route`. Both are `403`. The plaintext key string is returned **only once**, at creation. Validation of the caller's own key lives at `POST /api/auth/validate` (a separate controller, not fenced) and accepts any valid key.

#### GET /api/auth/api-keys

List all API keys, newest first. The plaintext key is never returned.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Response** `200`

Bare JSON array (no envelope), ordered by `createdAt` DESC. Null array/date fields are omitted.

```json

    "usageCount": 42,
    "createdAt": "2026-06-01T10:00:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` key role below ADMIN, or the key is session-scoped

#### GET /api/auth/api-keys/:id

Get a single API key's details by id. No plaintext key.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Path parameters**

  "usageCount": 42,
  "createdAt": "2026-06-01T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid key · `403` key role below ADMIN, or the key is session-scoped · `404` `"API key with id '<id>' not found"`

#### POST /api/auth/api-keys

Create a new API key; returns the full plaintext key exactly once.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Request body** — `CreateApiKeyDto`

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | yes | length 3–100 | Friendly name for the key. |
| `role` | enum `admin` \| `operator` \| `viewer` | no | `@IsEnum` | Defaults to `operator` when omitted. |
| `allowedIps` | string[] | no | each entry a valid **IPv4** address or IPv4 CIDR `/0-32`; IPv6 rejected | IP whitelist (IPv4-only by design). |
| `allowedSessions` | string[] | no | each `@IsString` | Session IDs this key may access. |
| `expiresAt` | string (ISO 8601 date) | no | `@IsDateString` | Stored as a `Date`. |

  "allowedSessions": ["session-uuid-1"],
  "expiresAt": "2027-12-31T23:59:59Z"
}
```

**Response** `201` — `ApiKeyCreatedResponseDto`

Same shape as the read DTO **plus** an `apiKey` field carrying the full plaintext key `owa_k1_<64 hex>`. This is the **only** time the plaintext key is returned. `keyPrefix` is the first 12 chars; `usageCount` starts at `0`, `isActive` is `true`. Null `allowedIps`/`allowedSessions`/`expiresAt`/`lastUsedAt` are omitted.

```json

  "apiKey": "owa_k1_0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef"
}
```

**Errors:** `400` validation (bad `name` length, invalid `role` enum, non-IPv4 `allowedIps` entry, bad `expiresAt`, or any non-whitelisted body field) · `401` missing/invalid key · `403` key role below ADMIN, or the key is session-scoped

#### PUT /api/auth/api-keys/:id

Update mutable fields of an API key. `isActive` is **not** updatable here — use the revoke route to deactivate.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string (uuid) | API key id. |

**Request body** — `UpdateApiKeyDto`

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | no | length 3–100 | Applied only if truthy. |
| `role` | enum `admin` \| `operator` \| `viewer` | no | `@IsEnum` | Applied only if truthy. |
| `allowedIps` | string[] | no | IPv4 address / CIDR only | Applied if not `undefined` (can be set to `[]` to clear). |
| `allowedSessions` | string[] | no | each `@IsString` | Applied if not `undefined`. |
| `expiresAt` | string (ISO 8601 date) | no | `@IsDateString` | Applied if not `undefined`; empty/falsy clears to `null`. |

```json
{
  "name": "Renamed Bot",
  "role": "viewer",
  "allowedIps": ["203.0.113.5"],
  "expiresAt": "2028-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

**Response** `200` — `ApiKeyResponseDto`

Returns the updated key (no plaintext).

```json
{
  "id": "3f2a1c9e-1b2d-4a5f-9c8e-aa11bb22cc33",

  "createdAt": "2026-06-01T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**Errors:** `400` validation (incl. `forbidNonWhitelisted` for unknown fields such as `isActive`) · `401` missing/invalid key · `403` key role below ADMIN, or the key is session-scoped · `404` not found · `409` change would remove the last usable admin key

#### POST /api/auth/api-keys/:id/revoke

Revoke (deactivate) an API key without deleting it. No request body required.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string (uuid) | API key id. |

**Response** `200` — `ApiKeyResponseDto`

Sets `isActive` to `false` and returns the key with explicit HTTP `200`. After revoke, the key fails validation with `401 "API key is revoked"`.

```json
{
  "id": "3f2a1c9e-1b2d-4a5f-9c8e-aa11bb22cc33",
  "name": "Production Bot",
  "keyPrefix": "owa_k1_a1b2",
  "role": "operator",
  "isActive": false,
  "usageCount": 42,
  "createdAt": "2026-06-01T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid key · `403` key role below ADMIN, or the key is session-scoped · `404` not found · `409` target is the last usable admin key

#### DELETE /api/auth/api-keys/:id

Permanently delete an API key (hard delete). Also drops any un-flushed usage accumulator.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string (uuid) | API key id. |

**Response** `204`

`@HttpCode(204)` — no response body.

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid key · `403` key role below ADMIN, or the key is session-scoped · `404` `"API key with id '<id>' not found"` · `409` target is the last usable admin key

#### POST /api/auth/validate

Validate the supplied `X-API-Key` and report its validity and role.

**Auth:** API key (any valid role — VIEWER+)

The key is read from the `X-API-Key` header, not the body; send an empty body. This route sits behind the global guard (it is not `@Public`), so a missing/invalid/revoked/expired key is rejected with `401` at the guard before the handler runs. On success it returns the caller's role.

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "valid": true, "role": "operator" }
```

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid/revoked/expired key (raised by the global guard before the handler)

> Implemented by `AuthValidateController` (`@Controller('auth')`), sharing the same `/api/auth` base.

### 6.4.10 System (Health, Metrics, Stats, Settings, Audit)

System endpoints expose operational status, Prometheus metrics, aggregate statistics, runtime settings, and the audit log. Health and metrics use non-standard auth (public / Bearer token); stats, settings and audit use the API key, with several routes gated to `ADMIN`.

#### GET /api/health

Basic health check returning status, the current timestamp, and the running app version.

**Auth:** public

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "status": "ok", "timestamp": "2026-06-25T12:34:56.789Z", "version": "0.7.3" }
```

Notes: `timestamp` is an ISO-8601 string (`new Date().toISOString()`). `version` is read from `package.json` at module load. Exempt from rate limiting (`@SkipThrottle`).

#### GET /api/health/live

Kubernetes liveness probe — returns a deliberately static body reflecting only process liveness; it does NOT probe dependencies.

**Auth:** public

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "status": "ok" }
```

Notes: always `{ "status": "ok" }`. Intentionally static so a transient dependency outage does not trigger a pod kill. The handler never returns a non-200.

#### GET /api/health/ready

Readiness probe — verifies the `main` (auth/audit) and `data` TypeORM datasources respond to `SELECT 1` (each bounded to a 3000 ms timeout) and reports `503` while the app is draining/shutting down.

**Auth:** public

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "details": {
    "mainDatabase": { "status": "up" },
    "dataDatabase": { "status": "up" }
  }
}
```

**Errors:** `503` — either datasource fails or exceeds its 3 s `SELECT 1` timeout, or the app is shutting down. The handler throws `ServiceUnavailableException`, so NestJS wraps the custom `{ status, details }` object as the `message` field:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 503,
  "message": {
    "status": "error",
    "details": { "mainDatabase": { "status": "up" }, "dataDatabase": { "status": "down" } }
  },
  "error": "Service Unavailable"
}
```

During shutdown the `details` instead read `{ "shutdown": { "status": "draining" } }`. Probes run in parallel via `Promise.all`. There is no `health/detailed` route.

#### GET /api/metrics

Prometheus exposition scrape of OpenWA process + session + message metrics; gated by a `METRICS_TOKEN` bearer (disabled when the token is unset).

**Auth:** Bearer METRICS_TOKEN — `Authorization: Bearer <METRICS_TOKEN>`. This route is `@Public()` (it bypasses the `X-API-Key` guard); access is instead validated inside the service with a constant-time compare. The `Bearer ` prefix is stripped case-insensitively. Hidden from Swagger.

**Response** `200`

Content-Type `text/plain; version=0.0.4; charset=utf-8`, `Cache-Control: no-store`. Raw text (no JSON envelope):

```
# HELP openwa_up 1 if the OpenWA process is running
# TYPE openwa_up gauge
openwa_up 1

Values come from `StatsService.getOverview()` plus `process.memoryUsage()`/`process.uptime()`. The render is memoized for 5000 ms to avoid re-running the overview query on every scrape.

**Errors:** `401` — `METRICS_TOKEN` is configured but the bearer is missing or does not match (`{ "statusCode": 401, "message": "Invalid metrics token", "error": "Unauthorized" }`) · `404` — `METRICS_TOKEN` is unset/blank, so the endpoint is disabled (`{ "statusCode": 404, "message": "Metrics endpoint is disabled (set METRICS_TOKEN to enable)", "error": "Not Found" }`).

#### GET /api/stats/overview

Get overall cross-session aggregate statistics (sessions by status + message totals + today's counts).

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN) that is not restricted to specific sessions — a global cross-tenant aggregate, so a session-scoped key has no claim on it and is rejected with `403` (`@RequireUnscopedKey`).

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "sessions": {
    "active": 2,
    "total": 3,
    "byStatus": { "ready": 2, "disconnected": 1 }
  },
  "messages": {
    "sent": 1280,
    "received": 940,
    "failed": 4,
    "today": { "sent": 42, "received": 30 }
  }
}
```

Notes: raw handler return (no envelope). `sessions.byStatus` is keyed by the stored `SessionStatus` values — lowercase, per §6.4.1 — with per-status counts; `sessions.active` counts only `ready`. `messages.sent`/`received` are all-time outgoing/incoming COUNTs; `failed` is the `FAILED`-status COUNT; `today.*` are the same counts since local midnight. Side effect: caches the `sessions` block via `CacheService`.

**Errors:** `401` — missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` — key role below `ADMIN`, or the key is session-restricted.

#### GET /api/stats/messages

Get message statistics over a period: time series, counts by type, by session, and top chats.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN) that is not restricted to specific sessions — a cross-session aggregate, so a session-scoped key is rejected with `403` (`@RequireUnscopedKey`).

**Query parameters**

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `period` | `'24h' \| '7d' \| '30d'` | No | `24h` | Window for the report. `@IsIn(['24h','7d','30d'])` — any other value → `400`. Bucket interval is `hour` for `24h`, else `day`. |

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "timeSeries": [
    { "timestamp": "2026-06-25 10:00:00", "sent": 12, "received": 8 },
    { "timestamp": "2026-06-25 11:00:00", "sent": 20, "received": 14 }
  ],
  "byType": { "chat": 180, "image": 24, "unknown": 3 },
  "bySession": [
    { "sessionId": "9f1c…", "name": "support-line", "sent": 200, "received": 140 }
  ],
  "topChats": [
    { "chatId": "6281234567890@c.us", "messageCount": 320 }
  ]
}
```

Notes: raw handler return. `timeSeries.timestamp` is a DB-formatted bucket string — hourly `YYYY-MM-DD HH:00:00` for `24h`, daily `YYYY-MM-DD` for `7d`/`30d` — sorted ascending. `byType` keys are message-type strings (a null type becomes `unknown`). `bySession.name` is `Unknown` when the session is not found. `topChats` is the top 10 by `messageCount` DESC. All counts are numbers.

**Errors:** `400` — `period` not in the enum, or any non-whitelisted query field (strict `whitelist` + `forbidNonWhitelisted`) · `401` — missing/invalid API key · `403` — role below `ADMIN`, or the key is session-restricted.

#### GET /api/stats/sessions/:sessionId

Get statistics for a single session: identity, message counts, top chats, and 24 h hourly activity.

**Auth:** API key — any valid key (VIEWER and up); there is no `@RequireRole`. Scope still applies: the global guard feeds the `:sessionId` route param to the key's `allowedSessions`, so a session-scoped key asking for a session outside its list gets `401 "API key not authorized for this session"`. Only an unscoped key can read any session's stats.

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sessionId` | string | Session entity id. No format validation; `404` if no session matches. |

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "session": { "id": "9f1c…", "name": "support-line", "status": "ready" },
  "messages": { "sent": 200, "received": 140, "today": 18, "failed": 1 },
  "topChats": [
    { "chatId": "6281234567890@c.us", "count": 64, "lastActive": "2026-06-25 11:42:07" }
  ],
  "hourlyActivity": [
    { "hour": 0, "sent": 0, "received": 0 },
    { "hour": 1, "sent": 3, "received": 2 }
  ]
}
```

Notes: raw handler return. `session.status` is the `SessionStatus` enum value. `messages.sent`/`received` are all-time outgoing/incoming COUNTs; `today` is the total message count since local midnight; `failed` is the `FAILED`-status count. `topChats` is the top 10 by count DESC, with `lastActive` = `MAX(createdAt)` as a DB-native datetime string. `hourlyActivity` always has 24 entries (hour `0..23`), missing hours zero-filled, computed over the last 24 h.

**Errors:** `401` — missing/invalid API key, or the key is not scoped to this session · `404` — session not found (`Session not found`).

#### GET /api/settings

Get application settings (environment-derived; `general`/`api`/`notifications` groups).

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN) that is not restricted to specific sessions. Settings describe the whole deployment, so the route requires an unrestricted key (`@RequireUnscopedKey`): the role check alone does not exclude a key confined to a subset of sessions, which has no claim on deployment-wide configuration, so a session-scoped ADMIN key is rejected with `403`. A key below `ADMIN` is also rejected with `403`.

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "general": {
    "apiBaseUrl": "http://localhost:2785",
    "autoReconnect": true,
    "debugMode": false
  },
  "api": {
    "rateLimit": 100,
    "rateLimitWindow": 60000,
    "enableDocs": true
  },
  "notifications": {
    "emailEnabled": false,
    "notificationEmail": "",
    "webhookAlerts": true
  }
}
```

Notes: raw return of an in-memory `Settings` object built once in the controller constructor from `ConfigService` (snapshotted at construction, not re-read per request). `api.rateLimitWindow` is in ms. `enableDocs` reflects the `ENABLE_SWAGGER` gate (enabled by default outside production; disabled by default in production unless explicitly enabled). Only `notifications.*` is currently hardcoded (`emailEnabled: false`, `notificationEmail: ''`, `webhookAlerts: true`).

**Errors:** `401` — missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` — API key lacks the ADMIN role, or the key is session-restricted.

#### PUT /api/settings

Update settings — intentionally not implemented; always returns `501` (settings are env-derived and read-only at runtime).

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Request body** — none. There is no request DTO; any body is ignored (the exception is thrown before validation matters).

**Response** `501`

```json
{
  "statusCode": 501,
  "message": "Settings are derived from environment configuration and are read-only at runtime. Change the corresponding environment variable and restart the service.",
  "error": "Not Implemented"
}
```

Notes: the handler unconditionally throws `NotImplementedException`. Even an ADMIN key always gets `501`; there is no success response.

**Errors:** `401` — missing/invalid key · `403` — key lacks `ADMIN` · `501` — always (not implemented).

#### GET /api/audit

List audit-log entries, newest first. Every API-key lifecycle change, session/message/webhook event and ADMIN infra operation lands here.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)  ·  **Scope:** rows are confined to the calling key's `allowedSessions` — the `sessionId` query may only narrow within that list, never widen it

**Query parameters**

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `action` | string | No | — | Filter by `AuditAction` (e.g. `api_key_created`, `session_started`, `message_sent`, `webhook_failed`, `infra_data_imported`). |
| `severity` | `'info' \| 'warn' \| 'error'` | No | — | Filter by `AuditSeverity`. |
| `sessionId` | string | No | — | Narrow to one session. A value outside the key's `allowedSessions` returns `{ "data": [], "total": 0 }`. |
| `apiKeyId` | string | No | — | Filter by the acting key's id. |
| `limit` | integer | No | `50` | Page size, clamped to a maximum of `200`. |
| `offset` | integer | No | `0` | Rows to skip; a negative value resolves to `0`. |

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "6b3f…",
      "action": "session_started",
      "severity": "info",
      "apiKeyId": "1c2d…",
      "apiKeyName": "dashboard",
      "sessionId": "9f1c…",
      "sessionName": "support-line",
      "ipAddress": "203.0.113.7",
      "userAgent": "curl/8.4.0",
      "method": "POST",
      "path": "/api/sessions/9f1c…/start",
      "statusCode": 200,
      "metadata": null,
      "errorMessage": null,
      "createdAt": "2026-06-25T11:42:07.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "total": 1
}
```

Unlike the other list routes this one is **not** a bare array: `data` is the page and `total` the unpaginated match count. Nullable columns (`apiKeyId`, `sessionId`, `metadata`, `errorMessage`, …) are `null` when the event has no such dimension.

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid API key · `403` key role below ADMIN

### 6.4.11 Administration (Infrastructure, Plugins, MCP)

Admin-facing operations: infrastructure status & config, the data/storage migration tooling, plugin lifecycle, and the optional MCP transport. Almost every route is **API key (ADMIN)**; the two exceptions are the public `GET /api/infra/health` and the `POST /mcp` JSON-RPC endpoint (see end of section).

> Note on the infra/MCP request bodies: the `POST /api/infra/import-data` body and the entire `POST /mcp` envelope (mounted as a raw Express handler, outside the Nest pipe chain) are **plain TS interfaces, not class-validator DTOs** — the global `whitelist`/`forbidNonWhitelisted` ValidationPipe does **not** run on them. Unknown fields pass through silently and no type/constraint checks happen, except the few field-level guards noted per endpoint. The other infra bodies — `SaveConfigDto` (`PUT /api/infra/config`), `RestartDto` (`POST /api/infra/restart`), `ImportStorageDto` (`POST /api/infra/storage/import`) — and the plugin DTOs (`InstallFromUrlDto`, `PluginConfigDto`, `PluginSessionsDto`) *are* class-validated and reject unknown fields with `400`.

---

#### GET /api/infra/health

Public liveness probe.

**Auth:** public

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "status": "ok", "timestamp": "2026-06-25T12:00:00.000Z" }
```

---

#### GET /api/infra/status

Aggregate infrastructure status (database, Redis, queue, storage, engine).

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "database": { "connected": true, "type": "sqlite", "host": "", "builtIn": false },
  "redis": { "enabled": false, "connected": false, "host": "localhost", "port": 6379, "builtIn": false },
  "queue": {
    "enabled": false,
    "webhooks": { "pending": 0, "completed": 0, "failed": 0 }
  },
  "storage": { "type": "local", "path": "./data/media", "builtIn": false },
  "engine": {
    "type": "whatsapp-web.js",
    "headless": true,
    "sessionDataPath": "./data/sessions",
    "browserArgs": "--no-sandbox --disable-gpu",
    "webVersion": "2.3000.1040641150-alpha",
    "webVersionSource": "auto"
  }
}
```

The `queue.webhooks` counters are live BullMQ job counts (`pending` = waiting + active + delayed; plus `completed`/`failed`), degrading to zeros when the queue is disabled or Redis is unreachable. `redis.connected` is a live probe.

`builtIn` (on `database`/`redis`/`storage`) reports whether OpenWA's own bundled container is actually running *and* backing this service, detected live from the labelled container; when Docker is unreachable it falls back to the saved `*_BUILTIN` intent from `data/.env.generated`. In S3 mode `storage` additionally carries `bucket` (when one is configured) and `s3Available` (a throttled re-probe); in local mode neither key is present. `engine.webVersion`/`engine.webVersionSource` (`pinned` / `auto` / `native`) appear only on `whatsapp-web.js`; `webVersion` is `null` until the auto-resolve first succeeds.

**Errors:** `401` missing/invalid key · `403` key role < ADMIN

---

#### GET /api/infra/engines

List available WhatsApp engine plugins.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Response** `200` — bare array

```json
[
  {
    "id": "whatsapp-web.js",
    "name": "WhatsApp Web.js",
    "enabled": true,
    "features": ["send", "receive", "media", "groups"],
    "library": { "name": "whatsapp-web.js", "version": "1.34.7" }
  }
]
```

`library` is optional and may be omitted per engine.

**Errors:** `401` · `403`

---

#### GET /api/infra/engines/current

Get the currently active engine type.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "engineType": "whatsapp-web.js" }
```

**Errors:** `401` · `403`

---

#### GET /api/infra/config

Read the saved infrastructure config from `data/.env.generated` (used to hydrate the dashboard form). **Secrets are never returned** — only `*Set`/`*CredentialsSet` booleans indicate that a secret is stored.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Response** `200` — `SavedConfigResponse`

```json
{
  "database": {
    "type": "sqlite", "builtIn": false, "host": "", "port": "",
    "username": "", "database": "", "schema": "public", "poolSize": 10,
    "sslEnabled": false, "sslRejectUnauthorized": true, "passwordSet": false
  },
  "redis": { "enabled": false, "builtIn": false, "host": "", "port": "", "passwordSet": false },
  "queue": { "enabled": false },
  "storage": {
    "type": "local", "builtIn": false, "localPath": "./data/media",
    "s3Bucket": "", "s3Region": "", "s3Endpoint": "", "s3CredentialsSet": false
  },
  "engine": {
    "type": "whatsapp-web.js", "headless": true,
    "sessionDataPath": "./data/sessions", "browserArgs": "--no-sandbox --disable-gpu"
  }
}
```

When `data/.env.generated` does not exist, empty-string/default values are returned (`schema='public'`, `poolSize=10`, `sslRejectUnauthorized=true`, `engine.type='whatsapp-web.js'`, `headless=true`).

**Errors:** `401` · `403`

---

#### PUT /api/infra/config

Merge-save infrastructure config to `data/.env.generated` (a `0600` secret file). A partial payload preserves untouched keys; empty/omitted secret fields keep the existing stored secret.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Request body** — `SaveConfigDto` (recursively class-validated; unknown or mistyped fields are rejected)

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `database` | object | No | — | DB section (see nested) |
| `database.type` | `'sqlite' \| 'postgres'` | If `database` is present | enum | `sqlite` drops stale postgres keys; `postgres` writes connection keys |
| `database.builtIn` | boolean | No | — | When `true`+postgres, forces the bundled `postgres` container creds + pushes `postgres` Docker profile |
| `database.host` / `.port` / `.username` / `.database` | string | No | `port` is a string | External postgres connection (defaults `localhost`/`5432`/`postgres`/`openwa`) |
| `database.schema` | string | No | — | Postgres schema, saved as `POSTGRES_SCHEMA`; an empty value writes `public` (also forced to `public` when switching to the built-in DB) |
| `database.password` | string | No | secret | Empty/omitted keeps the existing stored secret |
| `database.poolSize` | number | No | — | Default 10 |
| `database.sslEnabled` | boolean | No | — | Default false |
| `database.sslRejectUnauthorized` | boolean | No | — | Only written when `sslEnabled` is true; default true |
| `redis.enabled` / `.builtIn` | boolean | No | — | `builtIn`+enabled forces `redis` container + profile |
| `redis.host` / `.port` | string | No | `port` is a string | Defaults `localhost`/`6379` |
| `redis.password` | string | No | secret | Empty keeps existing |
| `queue.enabled` | boolean | No | — | Writes `QUEUE_ENABLED` |
| `storage.type` | `'local' \| 's3'` | If `storage` is present | enum | `local` drops stale S3 keys; `s3` drops `STORAGE_LOCAL_PATH` |
| `storage.builtIn` | boolean | No | — | `true`+s3 uses bundled MinIO defaults + pushes `minio` profile |
| `storage.localPath` | string | No | — | Default `./data/media` |
| `storage.s3Bucket` / `.s3Region` / `.s3Endpoint` | string | No | — | External S3 |
| `storage.s3AccessKey` / `.s3SecretKey` | string | No | secret | Empty keeps existing |
| `engine.type` | string | No | **must be a known engine id, else `400`** | The only validated field in the body |
| `engine.headless` | boolean | No | — | Default true; saved as `PUPPETEER_HEADLESS` |
| `engine.sessionDataPath` | string | No | — | Default `./data/sessions` |
| `engine.browserArgs` | string | No | — | Saved as `PUPPETEER_ARGS` |

```json
{
  "database": { "type": "postgres", "builtIn": false, "host": "db.example.com", "port": "5432", "username": "openwa", "password": "s3cret", "database": "openwa", "poolSize": 10, "sslEnabled": true, "sslRejectUnauthorized": false },
  "redis": { "enabled": true, "builtIn": true },
  "queue": { "enabled": true },
  "storage": { "type": "s3", "builtIn": false, "s3Bucket": "my-bucket", "s3Region": "ap-southeast-1", "s3AccessKey": "AKIA...", "s3SecretKey": "...", "s3Endpoint": "https://s3.example.com" },
  "engine": { "type": "whatsapp-web.js", "headless": true, "sessionDataPath": "./data/sessions", "browserArgs": "--no-sandbox --disable-gpu" }
}
```

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "message": "Configuration saved. Server restart required.", "saved": true, "envPath": "data/.env.generated", "profiles": ["postgres", "redis"] }
```

Write/IO errors are caught and returned as HTTP `200` with `{ "saved": false, "envPath": "", "profiles": [], "message": "Failed to save configuration: …" }`. DTO validation, an unknown engine type, and CR/LF injection are real HTTP `400` responses. `profiles` lists newly-required Docker profiles.

**Errors:** `400` unknown/mistyped body field, missing nested `database.type`/`storage.type`, unknown
`engine.type`, or CR-LF in a value · `401` · `403`

---

#### POST /api/infra/restart

Request a graceful server restart, optionally orchestrating Docker profiles (add/remove services). Schedules process shutdown as a side-effect.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Request body** — optional `RestartDto` (class-validated; unknown fields and non-string array members reject)

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `profiles` | string[] | No | `[]` | Docker profiles to enable/start (e.g. `postgres`, `redis`, `minio`) |
| `profilesToRemove` | string[] | No | `[]` | Docker profiles whose containers should be stopped/removed |

```json
{ "profiles": ["postgres", "redis"], "profilesToRemove": ["minio"] }
```

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "message": "Restarting…",
  "restarting": true,
  "profiles": ["postgres", "redis"],
  "profilesToRemove": ["minio"],
  "estimatedTime": 48
}
```

`estimatedTime` (seconds) = base 15 + 20/postgres + 13/redis + 15/minio + 5/removal. `orchestration` is present only when Docker is available and `profiles` is non-empty; `removal` only when Docker is available and `profilesToRemove` is non-empty. Without Docker, a `data/.orchestration-request.json` signal file is written instead. After responding, `shutdownService.shutdown()` runs (default ~3s grace); readiness returns `503` during drain.

**Errors:** `401` · `403`

---

#### GET /api/infra/export-data

Export every row of the 13 migration tables from the Data DB as JSON. Read-only, but runs raw `SELECT *` on the `data` DataSource.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

The migration set (`MigrationTables`) is, in payload-key order: `sessions`, `webhooks`, `messages`, `messageBatches`, `templates`, `baileysStoredMessages`, `lidMappings`, `pluginInstances`, `conversationMappings`, `ingressEvents`, `webhookDeliveryFailures`, `integrationDeliveryFailures`, `statusUpdates`.

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "exportedAt": "2026-06-25T12:00:00.000Z",
  "dataDbType": "sqlite",
  "tables": {
    "sessions": [ { "id": "s1", "name": "main", "status": "ready", "phone": "15551234567", "pushName": "Me", "config": {}, "proxyUrl": null, "proxyType": null, "connectedAt": "2026-06-25T00:00:00.000Z", "lastActiveAt": "2026-06-25T00:00:00.000Z", "createdAt": "2026-06-25T00:00:00.000Z", "updatedAt": "2026-06-25T00:00:00.000Z" } ],
    "webhooks": [],
    "messages": [],
    "messageBatches": [],
    "templates": [],
    "baileysStoredMessages": [],
    "lidMappings": [],
    "pluginInstances": [],
    "conversationMappings": [],
    "ingressEvents": [],
    "webhookDeliveryFailures": [],
    "integrationDeliveryFailures": [],
    "statusUpdates": []
  },
  "counts": { "sessions": 1, "webhooks": 0, "messages": 0, "messageBatches": 0, "templates": 0, "baileysStoredMessages": 0, "lidMappings": 0, "pluginInstances": 0, "conversationMappings": 0, "ingressEvents": 0, "webhookDeliveryFailures": 0, "integrationDeliveryFailures": 0, "statusUpdates": 0 },
  "skippedTables": []
}
```

Rows are raw DB column shapes (e.g. `messageBatches` rows use snake_case columns: `batch_id`, `session_id`, `current_index`, `created_at`, …). **`webhooks` rows include `secret` in cleartext**, and `pluginInstances` rows carry integration secrets — treat the payload as a credential dump. On Postgres the generated `body_ts` FTS column is stripped from `messages` so archives stay dialect-neutral.

`sessions`/`webhooks` are queried directly, so a hard DB error there yields `500`. The other 11 are queried tolerantly: a *genuinely missing* table (an older DB that has not run the migration) exports as `[]` and its name is listed in `skippedTables`; any other error (lock, I/O, timeout) fails the export rather than reporting the table as empty. Check `skippedTables` before restoring — a skipped table is "not migrated yet", not "exported empty".

**Errors:** `401` · `403` · `500` DB error

---

#### POST /api/infra/import-data

Replace all Data DB rows with the supplied export. **Destructive and transactional (all-or-nothing).**

> **The replace covers all 13 migration tables, not just the ones you send.** Inside the transaction every table in the migration set is emptied first and only then re-populated from the payload, so a table you omit ends up **empty**, not untouched. Always restore a payload produced by `GET /api/infra/export-data` of the same or a newer build — a hand-built body carrying only a subset silently wipes the rest.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Request body** — inline `{ tables: Partial<MigrationTables>; force?: boolean; stopOrphans?: boolean }` (plain interface, not class-validated)

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tables` | object | Yes | Container of per-table row arrays, keyed exactly as the export's `tables`. Accessing `data.tables` directly means a missing/null value throws `500` |
| `tables.sessions` | `SessionRow[]` | No | Inserted first; a row whose `name` is not a safe directory name is skipped with a warning (which then rolls the whole restore back) |
| `tables.webhooks` | `WebhookRow[]` | No | Includes `secret` |
| `tables.messageBatches` | `MessageBatchRow[]` | No | snake_case columns |
| `tables.*` (the remaining 10) | `Row[]` | No | Same keys as the export; an omitted table restores **zero** rows into an emptied table |
| `stopOrphans` | boolean | No | Stop the running engines for sessions the backup does not contain, inside this request and before the replace (best-effort, time-bounded per engine). Preferred over `force` |
| `force` | boolean | No | Legacy escape hatch: proceed despite orphaned engines and leave them running until a process restart (`restartRequired: true`) |

```json

**Response** `200`

```json
{
  "imported": true,
  "counts": { "sessions": 1, "webhooks": 0, "messages": 0, "messageBatches": 0, "templates": 0, "baileysStoredMessages": 0, "lidMappings": 0, "pluginInstances": 0, "conversationMappings": 0, "ingressEvents": 0, "webhookDeliveryFailures": 0, "integrationDeliveryFailures": 0, "statusUpdates": 0 },
  "warnings": [],
  "notices": [],
  "restartRequired": false,
  "orphanedEngines": [],
  "stoppedOrphanEngines": [],
  "failedOrphanEngines": []
}
```

`warnings` are per-row import failures — they force a **rollback** and `imported:false`. `notices` are non-fatal operator messages (orphan-engine reconciliation detail) and never roll anything back. `restartRequired` is `true` when engines were left pointing at sessions the restore removed (`force`) or when an orphan teardown failed. `orphanedEngines` lists the session ids with a live engine the restored data no longer contains; `stoppedOrphanEngines`/`failedOrphanEngines` report how `stopOrphans` went.

**Orphan-engine pre-flight.** Before the transaction opens, any running engine whose session id is absent from `tables.sessions` is an orphan (the replace would delete its DB row, leaving an unstoppable engine writing into freshly restored tables). Default behaviour is to refuse with `409` listing those ids; `stopOrphans: true` stops them in-request and proceeds; `force: true` proceeds and leaves them running until restart.

Because that pre-flight runs *before* the transaction, its teardown is not covered by the rollback. A response with `imported:false` therefore still reports the engines it really stopped, and `restartRequired` on that path means only that a teardown **failed** — a cleanly stopped orphan leaves its session row intact (restart it with `POST /sessions/{id}/start`), and an engine `force` left running was never orphaned after all, since the data that would have orphaned it was not replaced.

Inside the transaction every migration table is emptied. `webhooks` and `sessions` are DELETEd directly, so a missing table there fails the restore; the other 11 go through a tolerant helper where a *genuinely missing* table is skipped. Any other DELETE failure propagates to the rollback. Rows are then re-inserted, sessions first. JSON object/array fields are auto-stringified before insert, and the Postgres-form `$N` placeholders are rewritten for SQLite. Two guards return `imported:false` after a rollback: any `warnings`, and a payload that restores **zero** rows in total (a wrong/empty backup would otherwise commit a silent wipe — the response then carries `Backup contained no rows to restore; refused to replace existing data. Check the file.`). On commit the lid→phone mirror is reloaded from the restored rows.

**Errors:** `401` · `403` · `409` live engines exist for sessions the backup does not contain (retry with `stopOrphans` or `force`) · `500` `tables` missing/null or unrecoverable DB error

#### GET /api/infra/storage/files/count

File count and total size in the active storage backend.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "storageType": "local", "count": 128, "sizeBytes": 5242880, "sizeMB": "5.00" }

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "message": "Storage export completed", "download": "data/exports/storage-export-1750000000000-abc.tar.gz" }
```

`download` is a server filesystem path — feed it back to `POST /api/infra/storage/import`. The archive is auto-deleted after `STORAGE_EXPORT_TTL_MS` (default 1h).

**Errors:** `401` · `403` · `500`

---

#### POST /api/infra/storage/import

Import storage files from a `tar.gz` located inside the `data/` directory.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

#### GET /api/plugins

List all loaded plugins (built-in + installed), with secret config values redacted.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Response** `200` — `PluginDto[]` (bare array, `[]` if none)

```json
[
  {
    "id": "chat-flow",
    "name": "Chat Flow",
    "version": "1.0.0",

  }
]
```

`type` is one of `engine | storage | queue | auth | extension`; `status` is `installed | enabled | disabled | error`. `activeSessions: ["*"]` means all sessions. Optional fields: `configSchema`, `configUi`, `i18n`, `sessionConfig` (secrets redacted), `error`.

**Errors:** `401` · `403`

---

#### GET /api/plugins/catalog

List the remote plugin catalog annotated with this instance's install state. (Declared before `:id` so `catalog` is not captured as an id.)

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Response** `200` — bare array

```json
[
  {
    "id": "group-translate",
    "name": "Group Translate",

    "installed": true,
    "installedVersion": "1.1.0",
    "updateAvailable": true
  }
]
```

Returns `[]` when no `plugins.catalogUrl` is configured.

**Errors:** `400` catalog fetch failed / not a JSON array · `401` · `403`

---

#### GET /api/plugins/:id

Get a single plugin by id.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Plugin id |

**Response** `200` — single `PluginDto` (same shape as the list element, secrets redacted).

**Errors:** `401` · `403` · `404` `Plugin {id} not found`

---

#### GET /api/plugins/:id/config-ui

Serve a plugin's sandboxed config-UI entry HTML (for an opaque-origin iframe `srcdoc`; the dashboard
applies its document-specific CSP nonce to inline scripts and keeps any declared schema form available as fallback).

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Plugin id |

**Response** `200` — raw HTML (not JSON). Headers: `Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8`, `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`.

**Errors:** `401` · `403` · `404` plugin missing, no `configUi.entry`, file missing, or containment-check failure

---

#### GET /api/plugins/:id/health

Check a plugin's health (delegates to the loader / sandboxed workers).

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Plugin id |

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "healthy": true }
```

Internal failures are reported in-band as `{ "healthy": false, "message": "…" }` with HTTP 200.

**Errors:** `401` · `403` · `404` unknown id

---

#### POST /api/plugins/install

Install a plugin from an uploaded `.zip` package.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Request body** — `multipart/form-data` (no DTO)

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `file` | binary (`.zip`) | Yes | ≤ 5 MB; must contain a valid plugin manifest | Form field name is literally `file` |

**Response** `201` — the newly installed `PluginDto`.

**Errors:** `400` no file / invalid package / install failed · `401` · `403` · `409` plugin id or directory already exists

---

#### POST /api/plugins/install-url

Install a plugin by downloading its `.zip` from an HTTPS URL (SSRF-guarded fetch: host validated, redirects followed with every hop re-validated through the guard and the chain capped at 5 hops, size-capped at `plugins.downloadMaxBytes`, default 5 MB). Plain `http://` is rejected — the package is executable code and must be integrity-protected in transit; private-network targets remain subject to the SSRF guard. A redirect hop that downgrades back to plain `http://` mid-chain is likewise refused (set `PLUGIN_DOWNLOAD_ALLOW_INSECURE_REDIRECTS=true` only if your vendor genuinely redirects that way); a chain over the cap fails with an explicit "too many redirects" error.

Optional content pinning: append `#sha256=<64 hex>` (URL fragment — never sent to the server) to require the downloaded bytes to match that digest; the fragment is the only honored marker — query params are deliberately ignored. A mismatch or a malformed marker fails the install closed; no marker means no verification (HTTPS + the SSRF guard are the baseline).

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Request body** — `InstallFromUrlDto` (class-validated; extra fields → `400`)

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `url` | string | Yes | `@IsUrl({ protocols:['https'], require_protocol:true })` | Absolute https URL of the package; optional `#sha256=` digest pin |

```json
{ "url": "https://github.com/openwa-plugins/chat-flow/releases/download/v1.0.0/chat-flow.zip" }
```

**Response** `201` — the newly installed `PluginDto`.

**Errors:** `400` invalid URL / download, integrity check, or package invalid · `401` · `403` · `409` already installed

---

#### POST /api/plugins/:id/enable

Enable a plugin.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Plugin id |

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "success": true, "message": "Plugin enabled successfully" }
```

Enable failures are returned in-band as `{ "success": false, "message": "…" }` (still HTTP 200).

**Errors:** `401` · `403` · `404` unknown id

---

#### POST /api/plugins/:id/disable

#### PUT /api/plugins/:id/config

Update a plugin's base configuration object.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Plugin id |

**Request body** — `PluginConfigDto` (class-validated; body must be exactly `{config:{…}}`)

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `config` | object | Yes | `@IsObject()` | Whole config object. Masked/sentinel secret values mean "unchanged" and are restored from the stored config |

```json
{ "config": { "apiKey": "sk-...", "replyDelayMs": 1500 } }
```

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "success": true, "message": "Plugin configuration updated" }
```

Update failures are returned in-band as `{ "success": false, "message": "…" }` (HTTP 200).

**Errors:** `400` extra top-level field · `401` · `403` · `404` unknown id

---

#### PUT /api/plugins/:id/config/:sessionId

Set (or clear) a plugin config override for a specific session.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Plugin id |
| `sessionId` | string | Session the override applies to |

**Request body** — `PluginConfigDto`

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `config` | object | Yes | `@IsObject()` | Per-session override slice. Empty `{}` clears the override (falls back to base config). Masked secrets restored from the existing per-session value |

```json
{ "config": { "replyDelayMs": 3000 } }
```

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "success": true, "message": "Plugin configuration for session session-1 updated" }
```

**Errors:** `400` plugin is global (not session-scoped) / extra field · `401` · `403` · `404` unknown id

---

#### PUT /api/plugins/:id/sessions

Set which sessions a session-scoped plugin is activated for. This is a **full replacement** of the plugin's global activation set: the supplied `sessions` array overwrites `activeSessions` in its entirety (not a merge), so an omitted session is deactivated and `[]` deactivates the plugin for every session.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN) that is **not restricted to specific sessions** (`@RequireUnscopedKey`). Because the route replaces the whole activation set, a session-scoped key is rejected with `403` whatever it sends — even a request confined to its own `allowedSessions` would silently delete every other session's activation, so the fence refuses scoped keys before the handler runs. Use an unrestricted ADMIN key. (The per-session config override route `PUT /api/plugins/:id/config/:sessionId` is a different operation and stays scoped to the addressed session.)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Plugin id |

**Request body** — `PluginSessionsDto` (class-validated)

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sessions` | string[] | Yes | `@IsArray()`, `@IsString({ each:true })` | Session ids to activate for. `["*"]` = all, `[]` = none |

```json
{ "sessions": ["*"] }
```

**Response** `200` — the updated `PluginDto` (reflecting the new `activeSessions`).

**Errors:** `400` plugin is global · `401` · `403` key is session-scoped (full activation replacement requires an unrestricted key) · `404` unknown id

---

#### POST /api/plugins/:id/update

Update an installed plugin in place from a URL, preserving config + enabled state. The new package is written to a staging sibling and validated BEFORE the running plugin is stopped, then swapped in with two renames (live → backup, staging → live); a failure before or during the swap restores the previous version, and a process crash mid-swap is reconciled at boot (the backup is restored when the live directory is missing), so an interrupted update can never make the plugin silently vanish. Accepts the same optional `#sha256=` digest pin as `install-url` (fail-closed on mismatch).

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Plugin id (must match the package's manifest id) |

**Request body** — `InstallFromUrlDto` (class-validated)

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `url` | string | Yes | `@IsUrl({ protocols:['https'], require_protocol:true })` | Absolute https URL of the new `.zip` (SSRF-guarded download); optional `#sha256=` digest pin |

```json
{ "url": "https://example.com/plugins/chat-flow-1.1.0.zip" }
```

**Response** `201` — the updated `PluginDto`.

**Errors:** `400` download/package invalid, manifest id mismatch, or built-in plugin · `401` · `403` · `404` unknown id

---

#### DELETE /api/plugins/:id

Uninstall a plugin: dispatch its `onUnload` lifecycle hook, delete its files, drop its registry entry, and remove its `ctx.storage` data directory (`<dataDir>/plugins/<id>` — a separate tree when `PLUGINS_DIR` points outside the data dir). Built-in plugins are protected.

**Auth:** API key (ADMIN)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Plugin id |

**Response** `200`

```json
{ "success": true, "message": "Plugin uninstalled successfully" }
```

Note: this DELETE returns `200` with a body (not the usual `204`).

**Errors:** `400` cannot uninstall (e.g. built-in) · `401` · `403` · `404` unknown id

---

#### POST /mcp

MCP Streamable-HTTP / JSON-RPC 2.0 transport that exposes the agent-tool registry over the Model Context Protocol. **This is a transport, not a REST resource** — there is no NestJS controller, no DTO, and no `{success,data}` shape.

**Auth:** API key — sent as `X-Api-Key: <key>` **or** `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. Auth is enforced **per tool call** inside the MCP layer (not by the global Nest guard), so an auth failure surfaces in-band, not as an HTTP `401`.

Key facts:
- **Path is exactly `POST /mcp` — no `/api` prefix.** The global `api` prefix applies only to Nest controllers; this route is mounted straight on Express.
- Gated by **`MCP_ENABLED=true`**. When off, the module/route is never mounted and `POST /mcp` returns `404`.
- MCP is **read-only by default**: only read-tier tools are registered unless you set `MCP_READONLY=false` to expose write tools. Per-key sliding-window rate limit: `MCP_RATE_LIMIT_MAX` (default 60) per `MCP_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS` (default 60000).
- Stateless transport (no SSE/session id for normal calls).

**Request body** — JSON-RPC 2.0 envelope (validated by the MCP SDK, **not** the Nest ValidationPipe)

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `jsonrpc` | string | Yes | Must be `"2.0"` |
| `id` | string \| number \| null | No | Request id echoed back; null/absent for notifications |
| `method` | string | Yes | `initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`, plus MCP lifecycle methods. Unknown → JSON-RPC error `-32601` |
| `params` | object | No | Method-specific. For `tools/call`: `{ name, arguments }` where `arguments` must match the tool's zod `inputSchema` |

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 3, "method": "tools/call", "params": { "name": "session_send_text", "arguments": { "sessionId": "default", "to": "6281234567890", "text": "Hello from MCP" } } }
```

**Response** `200` — JSON-RPC 2.0 envelope

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 3,
  "result": { "content": [ { "type": "text", "text": "{\"success\":true,\"messageId\":\"…\"}" } ] }
}
```

For `tools/call` the result is an MCP `CallToolResult` (`content` array of `text` or embedded base64 `resource` items — payloads over 4096 bytes become a `resource`). **Tool-level failures are returned in-band as `CallToolResult` with `isError:true`** (HTTP stays 200), including missing/invalid API key (`name:'UnauthorizedException'`) and rate-limit hits (`message:'MCP rate limit exceeded'`).

**Errors:** in-band JSON-RPC errors `-32601` (unknown method), `-32602` (invalid params / unknown tool), `-32700` (parse error), all at HTTP 200 · `500` only if the transport throws before headers are sent · `404` when `MCP_ENABLED` is not `true`

> The full catalog of MCP tools (names, tiers, schemas) is documented separately — see **doc 24, MCP Integration**. This section documents only the transport endpoint.

### 6.4.12 Search

Base path `/api/search`. Cross-session full-text message search over an open `SearchProvider` contract;
the built-in database full-text provider (PostgreSQL `tsvector`/`GIN`, SQLite `FTS5`) answers by
default with zero external dependencies. Search is on by default; set `SEARCH_ENABLED=false` to remove
the route and module entirely (the index is DB-maintained regardless — see
[26 - Global Search](./26-global-search.md)). Requires at least `OPERATOR` role.

**Auth:** API key (≥ `OPERATOR`)  ·  **Scope:** session-scoped — a scoped key's `allowedSessions` is
injected server-side from the key (never from the query), so a scoped key cannot broaden its reach; an
ADMIN / null-allowlist key searches all sessions.

#### GET /api/search

Search messages across sessions (active search provider).

**Query parameters**

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `q` | string | **Yes** | — | Search term. Must be non-empty after trim; whitespace-only is rejected with `400`. Passed to the active provider's native full-text matcher. |
| `sessionId` | string | No | — | Restrict to a single session id (intersected with the key's `allowedSessions` scope). |
| `chatId` | string | No | — | Restrict to a single chat id. |
| `direction` | enum (`incoming` \| `outgoing`) | No | — | Filter by message direction. |
| `type` | string | No | — | Filter by stored message `type` (e.g. `text`, `image`, `video`). Compared against `messages.type`; not an enum validation, any string is accepted and unmatched values simply return no hits. |
| `from` | string | No | — | Filter by sender. |
| `dateFrom` | integer (epoch ms) | No | — | Inclusive lower bound on `timestamp`. A non-numeric value is rejected with `400`. |
| `dateTo` | integer (epoch ms) | No | — | Inclusive upper bound on `timestamp`. A non-numeric value is rejected with `400`. |
| `limit` | integer (≥ 1) | No | `50` | Max hits to return. Clamped to `SEARCH_LIMIT_MAX` (default `100`). A non-numeric value is rejected with `400`. |
| `offset` | integer (≥ 0) | No | `0` | Pagination offset. A non-numeric value is rejected with `400`. |

**Response** `200` — `SearchResults`

```json
{
  "hits": [
    {
      "messageId": "8f3c2b1a-9d4e-4c7a-8b2f-1e6d5a4c3b2a",
      "waMessageId": "true_62812...@c.us_3A...",
      "sessionId": "a1b2c3d4-...",
      "chatId": "6281234567890@c.us",
      "body": "full original message body...",
      "snippet": "...order <mark>confirmed</mark> for tomorrow…",
      "timestamp": 1751904000000,
      "type": "text",
      "direction": "incoming",
      "from": "6281234567890@c.us",
      "score": 0.075
    }
  ],
  "total": 23,
  "tookMs": 6,
  "provider": "builtin-fts"
}
```

- `snippet` is an XSS-safe text excerpt with `<mark>`/`</mark>` highlight markers around the matched
  term (both dialects emit the same markers). Render it as text, never as HTML.
- `total` is an exact count for pagination, computed lazily only when the returned page could be full.
- `provider` names which backend answered (e.g. `builtin-fts`); it is the registered `SearchProvider`
  id, so it changes when a plugin backend is selected via `SEARCH_PROVIDER`.
- `score` is optional and provider-specific (rank ordering is stable within a provider; cross-provider
  scores are not comparable).

**Errors:** `400` empty/whitespace `q`, a non-numeric `dateFrom`/`dateTo`/`limit`/`offset`, or a malformed
SQLite FTS5 query (unbalanced quote/paren, bare operator) — Postgres's `websearch_to_tsquery` is
tolerant and has no equivalent · `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` key role below `OPERATOR` ·
`501` no search provider configured (including a non-FTS5 SQLite build, where the provider is absent) ·
`503` active provider unhealthy (**reserved**: the built-in provider does not return it; it is the
contract surface for a future plugin provider whose `search()` throws `ServiceUnavailableException`).

> Scoping is authoritative: a scoped API key's `allowedSessions` is applied server-side and cannot be
> overridden via the query — there is no `sessionIds` query parameter, and `SearchService` overwrites
> any session scope at the provider boundary.

### 6.4.13 Profile (own account)

Manage the linked account's own profile. All routes are nested under `/api/sessions/:sessionId/profile` and require an **OPERATOR** key.

#### PUT /api/sessions/:sessionId/profile/name

Set the account display name (max 25 chars).

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Errors:** `400` session is not started / invalid name · `401` · `403` · `500` engine refused the change

#### PUT /api/sessions/:sessionId/profile/status

Set the account about/status text (max 139 chars; empty string clears it).

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

```json
{ "status": "We reply within one business day" }
```

**Response** `200` — `{ "success": true, "message": "Profile status updated" }`

**Errors:** `400` session is not started / status too long · `401` · `403`

#### PUT /api/sessions/:sessionId/profile/picture

Set the account profile picture from a URL or base64 image (same media DTO conventions as message sends, §6.3).

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

```json
{ "url": "https://example.com/avatar.png" }
```

or

```json
{ "base64": "iVBORw0KGgo...", "mimetype": "image/png" }
```

**Response** `200` — `{ "success": true, "message": "Profile picture updated" }`

### 6.4.14 Calls

Incoming-call management. A `call.received` webhook/socket event (§6.6) announces an incoming ringing call and carries the `callId` used below.

#### POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/calls/:callId/reject

Reject a currently ringing incoming call. Only a live call can be rejected — the id is valid while the call rings (a short server-side cache); afterwards it expires.

**Auth:** API key (OPERATOR)

**Path parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Session ID |
| callId | string | Call ID from the `call.received` event |

**Request body** — none.

**Response** `200` — `{ "success": true }`

**Errors:** `400` session is not started · `401` missing/invalid `X-API-Key` · `403` key lacks OPERATOR role · `404` call not found or no longer ringing

> **Auto-reject per session.** Set `"config": { "autoRejectCalls": true }` when creating a session to have the server reject every incoming call automatically — the `call.received` event is still dispatched first, so automations keep full visibility.

## 6.5 Real-time API (WebSocket)

Live events are delivered over a **Socket.IO** connection (not a raw WebSocket). The server mounts a single Socket.IO namespace, **`/events`**, on the same port as the REST API. There are no REST routes in this module.

### Connecting

Point a Socket.IO client at `<host>:2785` with path-less namespace `/events`:

```
ws://<host>:2785/events      (or wss:// behind TLS)
```

The client must authenticate during the Socket.IO handshake. Two sources are accepted, in this precedence order:

1. **Handshake `auth` (recommended)** — `io(url, { auth: { apiKey } })`. Not written to URLs or access logs.
2. **Header** — `x-api-key: <key>`.

> The former `?apiKey=<key>` query fallback was **removed** — it leaked the credential into proxy/access logs. Pass the key via the handshake `auth` field or the `x-api-key` header only.

If no key is supplied, or validation fails, the server emits an `error` message (`code: "UNAUTHORIZED"`) on the `message` event and immediately disconnects the socket. CORS for the namespace reuses the HTTP `CORS_ORIGINS` policy (dev allows any origin; production uses the allowlist).

### Protocol — client → server

All client commands are sent on the Socket.IO event named **`message`** using a single **flat** envelope:

```
{ type, sessionId, events, requestId }
```

| Field | Type | Applies to | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | `"subscribe" \| "unsubscribe" \| "ping"` | all | Command discriminator. |
| `sessionId` | string | subscribe, unsubscribe | A session id, or `"*"` for all sessions. |
| `events` | string[] | subscribe | Event names to subscribe to, or `["*"]` for all. |
| `requestId` | string (optional) | all | Echoed back on the matching server reply for correlation. |

A `ping` carries only `{ type: "ping", requestId? }`.

### Protocol — server → client

All server replies and pushed events also arrive on the Socket.IO event named **`message`**.

Command acknowledgements are **flat** and include an ISO-8601 `timestamp`:

```json
{ "type": "subscribed", "sessionId": "main", "events": ["message.received", "session.status"], "requestId": "r1", "timestamp": "2026-06-25T10:00:00.000Z" }
```

```json
{ "type": "unsubscribed", "sessionId": "main", "requestId": "r2", "timestamp": "2026-06-25T10:00:01.000Z" }
```

```json
{ "type": "pong", "requestId": "r3", "timestamp": "2026-06-25T10:00:02.000Z" }
```

```json
{ "type": "error", "code": "FORBIDDEN_SESSION", "message": "API key is not authorized for this session", "requestId": "r1", "timestamp": "2026-06-25T10:00:00.000Z" }
```

Live events are pushed as a **nested** envelope (note: `data` is under `payload`, and there is no `requestId`):

```json
{
  "type": "event",
  "timestamp": "2026-06-25T10:00:05.000Z",
  "payload": {
    "event": "message.received",
    "sessionId": "main",
    "data": { "id": "ABCD1234", "from": "6281234567890@c.us", "body": "hi", "timestamp": 1750000000 }
  }
}
```

Error `code` values include `UNAUTHORIZED`, `INVALID_MESSAGE`, `INVALID_SESSION`, `INVALID_EVENTS`, and `FORBIDDEN_SESSION`.

### Subscribable events

`events` accepts the wildcard `"*"` (all of the below) or any of these exact names:

```
message.received
message.sent
message.ack
message.revoked
message.reaction
message.edited
session.status
session.qr
session.authenticated
session.disconnected
group.join
group.leave
group.update
call.received
status.received
```

A subscribe request whose `events` array contains no recognized name (after filtering) is rejected with `INVALID_EVENTS`. Unknown names mixed with valid ones are silently dropped; the `subscribed` reply echoes only the accepted events.

> `message.failed` and `session.reconnect_loop` are webhook-only — they are not subscribable on the socket.

### Wildcards and scoping

- **`sessionId: "*"`** subscribes to every session; **`events: ["*"]`** subscribes to every subscribable event. They combine (e.g. `"*"` + `["*"]` = every event of every session).
- The API key is **re-validated on every `subscribe`** (not just at connect), so a key revoked or expired mid-connection is caught — the server replies `UNAUTHORIZED` and disconnects.
- **Per-key session scope is enforced** against the fresh key: a key restricted via `allowedSessions` may NOT subscribe to `"*"` and may NOT subscribe to a session outside its allowlist — either is rejected with `FORBIDDEN_SESSION`. An unrestricted key (no `allowedSessions`) may subscribe to anything, including `"*"`.

### Example (socket.io-client)

```js
import { io } from 'socket.io-client';

const socket = io('ws://localhost:2785/events', {
  auth: { apiKey: process.env.OPENWA_API_KEY },
});

socket.on('connect', () => {
  socket.emit('message', {
    type: 'subscribe',
    sessionId: 'main',
    events: ['message.received', 'message.ack', 'session.status'],
    requestId: 'sub-1',
  });
});

socket.on('message', (msg) => {
  if (msg.type === 'event') {
    console.log(`[${msg.payload.event}]`, msg.payload.sessionId, msg.payload.data);
  } else {
    console.log('reply:', msg); // subscribed | unsubscribed | pong | error
  }
});
```

## 6.6 Webhook Events & Delivery Semantics

Every registered webhook receives an HTTP `POST` with a JSON body of this shape:

```json
{
  "event": "message.received",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-02T10:00:00.000Z",
  "sessionId": "my-session",
  "idempotencyKey": "msg_my-session_3EB0ABC123",
  "deliveryId": "dlv_550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "data": { }
}
```

`event`, `timestamp` (ISO-8601 dispatch time), `sessionId`, `idempotencyKey`, and `deliveryId` are always present; `data` holds the event-specific payload. The same values are mirrored into request headers (below). The HMAC `signature` is **not** in the body — it travels in the `X-OpenWA-Signature` header.

### Event catalog

These are the events OpenWA actually emits. A webhook is registered with an `events` list; an event is delivered to a webhook when its `events` array includes the event name or `"*"`.

| Event | When it fires | `data` payload sketch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `message.received` | An inbound message arrives | The full message object: `id`, `from`, `to`, `body`, `type`, `timestamp` (epoch **seconds**), `isGroup`, `kind` (user-facing chat discriminator of `chatId` — `individual\|group\|channel\|status\|broadcast\|unknown`), `hasMedia`, `contact{…}` (plus optional `senderPhone` for `@lid` senders) |
| `message.sent` | An outbound message is created/sent from this session | Same message object shape as `message.received` |
| `message.ack` | A delivery/read receipt updates an outbound message | `{ id, messageId, status, ack }` — `status` is the canonical state (`pending`/`sent`/`delivered`/`read`/`failed`); `ack` is the deprecated legacy integer derived from it |
| `message.failed` | A receipt resolves to `failed` (dispatched in addition to `message.ack`) | `{ id, messageId, status: "failed", ack: -1 }` |
| `message.revoked` | A message is deleted/recalled | `{ id, revokedId?, chatId, from, to, type: "revoked", body: "", timestamp }` — **reconcile on `revokedId`** (the original deleted message's id), falling back to `id`. On whatsapp-web.js `id` is the *revocation notification* (a distinct message that won't match a stored id) and `revokedId` may be absent when the original isn't cached locally; on Baileys the two coincide |
| `message.reaction` | A reaction is added, changed, or removed | `{ messageId, chatId, reaction, senderId, reactions }` — `reactions` is the post-apply `{ senderId: emoji }` snapshot; `reaction` is empty when removed |
| `message.edited` | A message body or media caption is edited | `{ messageId, chatId, body, senderId, from, to, fromMe, isGroup, type, hasMedia, author?, mentionedIds?, timestamp }` — `messageId` is the original message id, `body` is the latest text/caption, and `timestamp` is the edit occurrence time in epoch **seconds** (not the original creation time) |
| `session.qr` | A new pairing QR is generated | `{ sessionId, qr }` (raw QR string) |
| `session.authenticated` | The session pairs and becomes ready | `{ sessionId, phone, pushName }` |
| `session.disconnected` | The session disconnects on the engine or WhatsApp side (drop, conflict, or a phone-initiated unlink). Not fired for API-initiated stop/logout/delete — those are acknowledged by the API response and the `session.status` transition | `{ sessionId, reason }` |
| `session.reconnect_loop` | Every 5th consecutive reconnect attempt is scheduled (attempt 5, 10, 15, …) — the session is failing to come back up | `{ sessionId, attempts, nextDelayMs }` |
| `session.status` | The session status transitions | `{ sessionId, status }` where `status` is one of `created` / `initializing` / `qr_ready` / `authenticating` / `ready` / `disconnected` / `action_required` / `failed` |
| `group.join` | Participant(s) are added to or join a group this session is in | `{ groupId, actorId?, participantIds, timestamp }` — `actorId` is the admin/inviter when known |
| `group.leave` | Participant(s) leave or are removed from a group | `{ groupId, actorId?, participantIds, timestamp }` |
| `group.update` | Group metadata changes (subject, description, announce/locked settings) | `{ groupId, actorId?, participantIds, changes?, timestamp }` — `changes` carries only the fields that changed: `subject?`, `description?`, `announce?`, `locked?` |
| `call.received` | An incoming voice/video call starts ringing | `{ callId, from, isVideo, isGroup, timestamp }` — `callId` is the id to pass to `POST /sessions/:sessionId/calls/:callId/reject` |
| `status.received` | A contact posts a status/story (opt-in — see below) | `{ sessionId, statusId, contact: { id, name?, pushName? }, type, caption?, hasMedia, mediaOmitted, omitReason?, postedAt, expiresAt }` — `statusId` is the store's `id` (usable with the status endpoints below); `postedAt`/`expiresAt` are epoch **milliseconds** (unlike the epoch-seconds convention for message timestamps), matching the `GET /status` store's own `Date`-backed fields |

> **`status.received` is opt-in and carries no media blob.** Unlike every other event above, `status.received` is only delivered to a webhook whose `events` list explicitly includes `"status.received"` (or `"*"`) — registering for other events does not implicitly subscribe you to it. The payload never embeds media bytes: when `hasMedia` is `true`, fetch the file separately via `GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/status/:statusId/media`. Your own posted statuses never trigger this event — only inbound stories from contacts (an own-send echo is dropped before ingest).

> **`STORE_EPHEMERAL_MESSAGES=false` affects `message.received`.** When `STORE_EPHEMERAL_MESSAGES` is set to `false`, incoming disappearing messages (those with `ephemeralDuration > 0`) are **not** persisted nor dispatched — no DB insert, no webhook delivery, and no websocket event. Downstream consumers and the dashboard both stop seeing them. Default is `true` (backward compatible — store and dispatch everything).

> **Large media is not inlined into webhook payloads.** A `media` blob whose decoded size exceeds `WEBHOOK_MEDIA_INLINE_MAX_BYTES` (default **1 MiB**; `0` = never inline) is replaced — before the payload is fanned out to your webhook — with the marker form `media: { mimetype, filename?, omitted: true, sizeBytes }`, the same shape the engine emits for capped inbound media. Media at or under the cap stays inline unchanged. Additionally, if the serialized body still exceeds `WEBHOOK_MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES` (default **1 MiB**) after `webhook:before` hooks ran, any remaining inline media is shed the same way so the event is still delivered; only a payload that is over budget *without* inline media is dropped (recorded in `GET /api/webhooks/delivery-failures`). Because shedding happens before enqueue, queued and failed BullMQ jobs in Redis never carry the blob either — failed-job retention is bounded by the queue's `removeOnComplete`/`removeOnFail` windows (1h/1000 completed, 24h/5000 failed). Fetch the media itself afterwards via `GET /api/sessions/:sessionId/messages/:chatId/history?includeMedia=true` when you need it.

> There is **no** `contact.update` or `presence.update` event, and no `call.accepted` / `call.terminated` lifecycle event yet — only `call.received` is emitted.

> **Group-event timing caveat (Baileys).** Membership/metadata changes that occurred while a Baileys session was offline are replayed by WhatsApp on reconnect and are dispatched like live events — but the engine does not forward their original occurrence time, so they carry the **receipt time** as `timestamp`. Treat `group.*` payloads as change notifications rather than a precise clock; stale offline *calls* are never emitted this way (they are filtered by the `offline` flag).

### Delivery semantics — at-least-once

Webhook delivery is **at-least-once**. A consumer can legitimately receive the same logical event more than once because:

- The underlying WhatsApp engine can re-fire an event for a single message.
- A failed delivery (non-2xx response, timeout, or network error) is retried.

**Design your handler to be idempotent**, keyed on the `X-OpenWA-Idempotency-Key` header (see below). As a server-side safety net, OpenWA de-duplicates inbound `message.received` before dispatch (a re-fired event for an already-persisted message is dropped), so one webhook normally sees each inbound message once — but this is best-effort defense-in-depth and does not remove the need for consumer-side idempotency.

### HMAC signature

When a webhook is registered with a `secret`, each delivery carries:

```
X-OpenWA-Signature: sha256=<hex>
```

The hex is an HMAC-SHA256 computed over the **raw JSON request body** (exactly the bytes sent) using the webhook's `secret`. Verify by recomputing over the raw body — not over a re-serialized parse — and compare in constant time:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verify(rawBody, header, secret) {
  const expected = 'sha256=' + crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret).update(rawBody).digest('hex');
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(header), Buffer.from(expected));
}
```

If no `secret` is configured the `X-OpenWA-Signature` header is omitted entirely.

### Idempotency & delivery headers

Every delivery includes:

| Header | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `X-OpenWA-Event` | The event name (mirrors `event`) |
| `X-OpenWA-Idempotency-Key` | Content-derived key; **stable across retries** of the same occurrence — dedupe on this |
| `X-OpenWA-Delivery-Id` | A fresh `dlv_<uuid>` generated **per delivery** (differs per retry and per webhook) — for tracing, not dedup |
| `X-OpenWA-Retry-Count` | Retry attempt number (`0` = first attempt) |
| `X-OpenWA-Signature` | HMAC (only when a secret is set) |

**Idempotency key derivation.** The key is content-derived so duplicates of the same logical event collapse to one value:

- `message.received` / `message.sent`: `msg_{sessionId}_{messageId}`
- `message.ack`: `ack_{sessionId}_{messageId}_{status}`
- `message.failed`: `failed_{sessionId}_{messageId}_{status}`
- `message.revoked`: `rev_{sessionId}_{messageId}`
- `message.edited`: `edit_{sessionId}_{messageId}_{occurredAt}`
- `message.reaction`: `react_{sessionId}_{messageId}_{senderId}_{occurredAt}`
- `session.qr`: `qr_{sessionId}_{hash(qr)}`
- `session.status`: `sess_{sessionId}_{status}_{occurredAt}`
- `session.authenticated`: `auth_{sessionId}_{hash(data)}_{occurredAt}`
- `session.disconnected`: `disc_{sessionId}_{hash(reason)}_{occurredAt}`
- `group.join` / `group.leave`: `grp_{groupId}_{hash(participantIds)}_{join|leave}_{occurredAt}`
- `group.update`: `grp_{groupId}_update_{hash(changes)}_{occurredAt}`
- `call.received`: `call_{sessionId}_{callId}` (a call id is unique per call, so no `occurredAt` salt)

Recurring lifecycle events (and `message.reaction` / `message.edited`) carry the same content across occurrences — the same phone on every reconnect, a constant disconnect reason, a re-applied emoji, or editing the same message multiple times — so they are salted with an `occurredAt` timestamp captured **once per dispatch and reused across that dispatch's retries**. This gives distinct occurrences distinct keys while keeping retries of one occurrence stable. Message keys are scoped by `sessionId` because WhatsApp message ids are unique per account, not globally.

### Retries with exponential backoff

When the queue is enabled, a non-2xx response, timeout (`WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT`, default `10000` ms), or network error schedules a retry. The number of attempts comes from the webhook's `retryCount` (default `3`) and the delay grows **exponentially** from a base of `WEBHOOK_RETRY_DELAY` (default `5000` ms). Each retry reuses the same `idempotencyKey` and increments `X-OpenWA-Retry-Count`. If Redis/BullMQ rejects the initial enqueue, OpenWA logs a `webhook:error` hook event and falls back to direct delivery with the same inline retry budget. When the queue is disabled, delivery is direct with the same retry budget applied inline.

### SSRF guard on registration

Webhook URLs are validated at **registration time**, not just at delivery. When SSRF protection is enabled (the default), creating or updating a webhook with a URL that resolves to a private/internal/loopback address is rejected synchronously with `400 Bad Request` instead of failing silently later at delivery. The `SSRF_ALLOWED_HOSTS` escape-hatch applies equally to registration and delivery. Operator-supplied custom headers that target reserved names (`Content-Type` or any `X-OpenWA-*`) are stripped, so a webhook config cannot forge the signature, event, or idempotency headers.
