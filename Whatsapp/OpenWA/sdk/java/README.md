# OpenWA Java SDK

Official Java client for the [OpenWA](https://github.com/rmyndharis/OpenWA)
WhatsApp API Gateway.

Hand-written against the exact API surface (paths, DTOs, response shapes) and
unit-tested with a mock HTTP transport that asserts on the precise request URL,
method, and body — so contract drift is caught at test time. Synchronous,
Java 17+, one runtime dependency ([Gson](https://github.com/google/gson)).

## Install

**Maven**

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.rmyndharis</groupId>
  <artifactId>openwa</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.1</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle**

```groovy
implementation 'com.rmyndharis:openwa:0.1.1'
```

## Quickstart

```java
import com.rmyndharis.openwa.OpenWAClient;
import com.rmyndharis.openwa.model.MessageResponse;
import com.rmyndharis.openwa.model.SendTextRequest;

OpenWAClient client = new OpenWAClient("http://localhost:2785", "owa_k1_…");

client.sessions.start("my-session");

MessageResponse result = client.messages.sendText("my-session",
    SendTextRequest.builder()
        .chatId("628123456789@c.us")
        .text("Hello from the OpenWA Java SDK!")
        .build());

System.out.println(result.messageId());
```

For full control over configuration (timeout, default headers, a custom
transport), build a `ClientConfig`:

```java
import com.rmyndharis.openwa.ClientConfig;
import java.time.Duration;

OpenWAClient client = new OpenWAClient(ClientConfig.builder()
    .baseUrl("https://wa.example.com")
    .apiKey("owa_k1_…")
    .timeout(Duration.ofSeconds(15))
    .build());
```

## Resources

The client exposes the same fluent resource surface as the JavaScript, Python,
and PHP SDKs:

`sessions` · `messages` · `contacts` · `groups` · `webhooks` · `chats` ·
`labels` · `channels` · `catalog` · `status` · `templates` · `health` · `search` ·
`profile` · `calls`,
plus `client.auth()`.

Operator-only modules (`docker`, `metrics`, `infra`, `plugins`, `mcp`) are
intentionally not exposed; all user-facing resources are.

## Error handling

Errors are a typed, unchecked hierarchy — branch with `instanceof` or on
`.status()`:

```java
import com.rmyndharis.openwa.errors.OpenWAConflictError;
import com.rmyndharis.openwa.errors.OpenWANotFoundError;

try {
    client.messages.sendText("my-session", body);
} catch (OpenWAConflictError e) {
    // 409 — engine not ready
} catch (OpenWANotFoundError e) {
    // 404 — session or chat not found
}
```

| Class                        | HTTP | Meaning                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `OpenWAAuthError`            | 401  | Missing or invalid API key               |
| `OpenWAForbiddenError`       | 403  | API key role insufficient                |
| `OpenWANotFoundError`        | 404  | Resource not found                       |
| `OpenWAConflictError`        | 409  | Engine not ready                         |
| `OpenWARateLimitError`       | 429  | Rate limited                             |
| `OpenWANotImplementedError`  | 501  | Active engine does not support the call  |
| `OpenWAApiError`             | —    | Any other non-2xx (carries `.status()`)  |
| `OpenWATimeoutError`         | —    | Request exceeded the configured timeout  |

All extend `OpenWAError` (a `RuntimeException`).

## Reliability & security

- **Use HTTPS in production.** The API key is sent as `X-API-Key` on every
  request and is bearer-equivalent — never send it over plaintext `http://`
  outside local development.
- **No automatic retries.** A failed request throws immediately; wrap calls in
  your own backoff if you need retries (especially for `429`). Inject a custom
  `HttpTransport` for retry or observability middleware.
- **Redirects are never followed.** A `3xx` surfaces as an `OpenWAApiError`
  rather than being followed, so the API key is never re-sent to a redirect
  target.
- **Default per-request timeout** is 30 s (configurable). Path segments (chat /
  message ids) are percent-encoded; a base-URL path prefix (e.g. behind a proxy
  at `/v1`) is preserved.

## Development

```bash
cd sdk/java
mvn -B verify        # compile + run the full test suite
```

Tests inject a recording `HttpTransport` and assert on the exact path — so the
regression that would ship a broken `messages/text` path (the real path is
`messages/send-text`) can never recur silently.

## Releasing

Publishing to Maven Central is done by the
[`java-sdk-release.yml`](../../.github/workflows/java-sdk-release.yml) workflow,
which deploys with `mvn -B -Prelease deploy`. The `release` profile attaches the
sources/javadoc jars, GPG-signs every artifact, and auto-publishes via the
Sonatype Central Publishing plugin — a plain `mvn verify` never runs any of it.

One-time setup (repository secrets):

- `MAVEN_CENTRAL_USERNAME` / `MAVEN_CENTRAL_PASSWORD` — the two halves of a
  Sonatype Central Portal user token for the verified `com.rmyndharis`
  namespace.
- `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` — ASCII-armored signing key.
- `GPG_PASSPHRASE` — passphrase for that key.

Until the secrets exist the workflow cleanly no-ops (it prints a notice and
skips the deploy), so tagging early is harmless.

Cutting a release:

1. Bump `<version>` in `pom.xml` and land it on `main`.
2. Tag that commit `java-sdk-v<version>` (e.g. `java-sdk-v0.1.1`) and push the
   tag. The SDK has its own version line — the monorepo's `v*` tags are the app
   version and never trigger an SDK publish.
3. The workflow builds, signs, and publishes; Central syncs within a few hours.
