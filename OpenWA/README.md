## ✨ Why OpenWA?

**OpenWA** is a free, open-source WhatsApp API Gateway designed for developers who need full control over their messaging infrastructure—without vendor lock-in or hidden paywalls.

Built on a **pluggable architecture**, OpenWA lets you select database engines (SQLite/PostgreSQL), backup/migration storage backends (Local/S3), and cache layers (disabled/Redis) through configuration rather than application-code changes. Message media itself is returned inline to API and webhook consumers; it is not automatically persisted to the storage backend.

## ⚠️ Before you connect a number — please read

OpenWA is an unofficial, community-maintained gateway. It connects to WhatsApp through **reverse-engineered clients** (the [`whatsapp-web.js`](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js) project and [`@whiskeysockets/baileys`](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys)), **not** through Meta's official Cloud API. This has real consequences you should understand before you link a phone number.

### What this means in practice

- **There is always a non-zero risk of account restriction or ban.** WhatsApp's anti-abuse systems actively look for unofficial automation. No amount of code quality on our side can make that risk zero.
- **Pick the right number.** Never connect your primary personal or business number to an automated gateway. Use a **dedicated number** you can afford to lose. If you're running this for paying clients, pass that guidance on to them.
- **The two engines trade off differently:**

  | Engine            | Ban-risk profile                                                                                        | Resource cost                     |
  | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
  | `whatsapp-web.js` | Lower — drives a real headless Chromium that looks like genuine WhatsApp Web traffic.                   | High RAM (~300–500 MB / session). |
  | `baileys`         | Higher — speaks the multi-device WebSocket protocol directly and is easier for WhatsApp to fingerprint. | Low RAM (~30–80 MB / session).    |

  If account safety is your top priority and you can afford the memory, prefer `whatsapp-web.js`. If you need density and accept the trade-off, use `baileys`.

### Safe-sending guidelines

These are practical guardrails, not guarantees — but they materially reduce the chance of WhatsApp flagging the account:

1. **Warm up fresh numbers.** For the first several days, behave like a normal human user: scan the QR, exchange a handful of messages with saved contacts, join a group or two, set a profile photo. Don't blast on day one.
2. **Don't cold-blast strangers.** Sending the first-ever message to a large batch of numbers that have never messaged you is the single most reliable way to get restricted — on either engine.
3. **Rate-limit yourself.** OpenWA ships with a configurable rate limiter (`RATE_LIMIT_*` env vars). Use it. A few messages per minute per session is sustainable; "thousands in an hour" is not.
4. **Use opted-in recipients.** The safest workloads are replies and alerts to people who already expect to hear from you (OTP to your own users, order updates, support replies).
5. **Keep a fallback.** For anything auth-critical or revenue-critical, keep an SMS / email / official-Cloud-API path. Do not bet a login flow solely on an unofficial client.
6. **Mind the hosting IP.** Cheap datacenter IPs are flagged more aggressively than residential ones. A residential proxy (supported per-session via the proxy settings) can help; it is not a license to spam.

### Known platform behaviour (not bugs)

A few things that look like bugs but are actually server-side WhatsApp policy, not OpenWA defects — we track them separately so we can distinguish them from real bugs:

- **First message to a brand-new contact sometimes never arrives.** The API returns success because the message leaves OpenWA, but WhatsApp's server-side reach-out / trust policy drops it at delivery. This is independent of OpenWA. We track it in [#830](https://github.com/rmyndharis/OpenWA/issues/830).
- **Accounts that get restricted cannot be "unrestricted" by us.** If WhatsApp disables a number, you need to appeal through their channels — OpenWA has no lever to pull.

### Compliance

For any deployment where ethical, legal, or regulatory compliance matters (healthcare, finance, large-scale commercial messaging, anything touching end users in the EU/EEA under DMA/GDPR framings), treat OpenWA as **not approved** and use Meta's [official WhatsApp Cloud API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api). OpenWA is an excellent fit for personal projects, internal tooling, automation hobbyists, and learning — it is not a drop-in replacement for the official API in regulated environments.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option A: Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone and start
git clone https://github.com/rmyndharis/OpenWA.git
cd OpenWA
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# Access (the dashboard is bundled into the API image and served on the same port)
# Dashboard: http://localhost:2785
# API: http://localhost:2785/api
# Swagger: http://localhost:2785/api/docs
```

> **Using Podman instead of Docker?**
> Podman rootless mode requires the socket to be running and `DOCKER_HOST` to be set:
>
> ```bash
> systemctl --user start podman.socket
> systemctl --user enable podman.socket
> export DOCKER_HOST=unix:///run/user/$(id -u)/podman/podman.sock
> ```
>
> Add the `export` line to your `~/.bashrc` to make it permanent.

### Option B: Local Development

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/rmyndharis/OpenWA.git
cd OpenWA

# Install the locked dependencies (includes dashboard)
npm ci

# Start API + Dashboard (config is auto-generated on first run)
npm run dev

# Access (in dev the dashboard runs on the Vite server with hot reload)
# Dashboard: http://localhost:2886
# API: http://localhost:2785/api
# Swagger: http://localhost:2785/api/docs
```

Use `npm install` instead when intentionally changing dependencies. OpenWA's committed lockfile uses
registry artifacts only, so npm 12 works with its secure default that blocks Git dependencies; do not
disable that policy globally.

## 🔒 Security Architecture

### Docker Socket Proxy

The production stack never exposes `/var/run/docker.sock` directly to the application container. Instead, a dedicated `docker-proxy` sidecar (based on [`tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy`](https://github.com/Tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy)) acts as the sole gateway to the Docker daemon:

```
openwa-api  ──TCP 2375──▶  docker-proxy  ──unix──▶  /var/run/docker.sock
```

Only the operations needed for container orchestration are enabled (`CONTAINERS`, `IMAGES`, `VOLUMES`, `INFO`, `PING`, plus the `POST` method switch). The application connects via the `DOCKER_HOST=tcp://docker-proxy:2375` environment variable, which `DockerService` detects automatically. Note this is an operational gateway, not a fine-grained privilege boundary: with `POST` enabled the proxy admits every method to the enabled paths and cannot scope container-create payloads, so a compromised API container would be host-root-equivalent — see `SECURITY.md` for the full threat model, mitigations, and how to disable the proxy if you don't use the built-in datastore orchestration.

### Non-root Container Execution

The production image never runs the Node.js process as root. On startup, the container follows this chain:

```
dumb-init (PID 1)
  └─ docker-entrypoint.sh (root — fixes named-volume ownership via chown)
       └─ gosu openwa node dist/main  (drops to the openwa user)
```

- **dumb-init** is PID 1 and forwards signals (SIGTERM, etc.) for graceful shutdown.
- **docker-entrypoint.sh** runs as root only long enough to `chown` the named-volume mount points so the `openwa` user can write to them.
- **gosu** performs a clean `exec`-based privilege drop — no `su` or `sudo` wrappers, so the node process is the direct child of dumb-init.

Named volumes (e.g. `openwa-data`) get their ownership corrected automatically on every start, so no manual `chown` step is needed after volume creation.

---

## 🏭 Production Deployment

For production, use the main `docker-compose.yml` with optional services:

```bash
# Basic production (SQLite, local storage)
docker compose up -d

# With PostgreSQL database
docker compose --profile postgres up -d

# Full stack (PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO)
docker compose --profile full up -d
```

| Profile    | Services              |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| `postgres` | PostgreSQL database   |
| `redis`    | Redis cache           |
| `minio`    | S3-compatible storage |
| `full`     | All services above    |

> The dashboard is bundled into the API image and served by NestJS on the API port, so it
> needs no profile — it is always available wherever `openwa-api` runs. For TLS/public exposure,
> put your own reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, a cloud load balancer, or a k8s Ingress) in front;
> see the nginx example in `docs/12-troubleshooting-faq.md`.

> **Development vs Production**
>
> - Development (`docker-compose.dev.yml`): SQLite, local storage, API serves the bundled dashboard
> - Production (`docker-compose.yml`): Configurable database, profiles for optional services
>
> Official GHCR images are published as multi-arch manifests for:
>
> - `linux/amd64`
> - `linux/arm64`

## 🔌 Ports

## 📡 API Examples

### Create a Session

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:2785/api/sessions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"name": "my-bot"}'
```

### Start Session & Get QR Code

```bash
# Start the session
curl -X POST http://localhost:2785/api/sessions/{sessionId}/start \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"

# Get QR code (scan with WhatsApp)
curl http://localhost:2785/api/sessions/{sessionId}/qr \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Send a Message

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:2785/api/sessions/{sessionId}/messages/send-text \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "chatId": "628123456789@c.us",
    "text": "Hello from OpenWA!"
  }'
```

### Setup Webhook

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:2785/api/sessions/{sessionId}/webhooks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://your-server.com/webhook",
    "events": ["message.received", "session.status"],
    "secret": "your-hmac-secret"
  }'
```

> **Smart filters (optional):** add a `filters` object to fire the webhook only when conditions match
> (AND), e.g. `{ "conditions": [{ "field": "sender", "operator": "is", "value": ["1234567890@c.us"] }] }`.
> Fields: `sender` / `recipient` / `body` / `type` / `mentions` / `fromMe` / `hasMedia` / `isGroup`. A
> webhook with no filters behaves exactly as before. See the API specification for the full schema.

## 🤖 MCP Server (AI Agents)

OpenWA can expose a **curated set of tools over the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)** so AI agents (Claude, Cursor, …) can drive WhatsApp. It is **off by default** and **additive** — every REST route keeps working unchanged.

Set `MCP_ENABLED=true` to mount a stateless Streamable-HTTP transport at **`POST /mcp`** on the existing server (same port, no extra process). It exposes ~39 curated tools (sessions, messaging, contacts, basic group ops, webhook reads) — a focused surface rather than the full API, so agents aren't overwhelmed and destructive operations stay off the agent path.

```bash
MCP_ENABLED=true npm run start:prod   # or set MCP_ENABLED in your .env / compose
```

Point an MCP client at it (e.g. for Claude Code, a `.mcp.json` at your project root):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openwa": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:2785/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" }
    }
  }
}
```

The key can be passed as `Authorization: Bearer …` or `X-API-Key: …`. Every tool call goes through the **same API-key auth, role, and per-session scoping** as REST.

**Security guidance:**

- **Mint a dedicated, least-privilege key** for the agent — a non-admin, **session-scoped** key (`OPERATOR` role at most). The plaintext key is shown only once on creation; to rotate, create a new key and delete the old one.
- The key **must not** carry an IP allow-list (`allowedIps`) — there is no genuine client IP over MCP, so such a key is rejected.
- Set **`MCP_READONLY=true`** to mount only the read tools (no sends/writes).
- Set **`MCP_RATE_LIMIT_MAX`** (default `60`) to limit tool calls per API key per window.
- Set **`MCP_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`** (default `60000`) to control the sliding window size in milliseconds.
- **Do not expose `/mcp` to the public internet** without a fronting auth proxy. For a self-hosted, locally-reached deployment the static API key is appropriate; public exposure should use OAuth 2.1 (not yet built).
