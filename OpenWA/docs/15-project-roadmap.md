> SDK / docs-site / observability features are delivered **incrementally** as they're additive — they no
> longer gate a single version. The five client SDKs landed this way across `0.7.3`–`0.8.19`; the docs
> site, a Postman export, Grafana and OpenTelemetry remain open (see §15.6). The version **number**
> follows SemVer (see §15.2), not the theme.

### Risk Buffer

## 15.2 Version Numbering

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

MAJOR: Breaking changes
MINOR: New features (backward compatible)
PATCH: Bug fixes

Examples:
0.0.1 - Initial MVP
0.0.2 - Production Ready (Multi-session, Dashboard)
0.1.0 - Initial Stable Release (Full features)
0.1.1 - Bug fix for QR timeout
0.2.0 - i18n, Real-time Chats, Webhook Delivery-state & Hardening
0.3.0 - Engine Pluggability (Baileys engine, plugin layer)
1.0.0 - Enterprise Ready
2.0.0 - Breaking API changes
```

### Pre-1.0 policy (we are here)

While the project is on `0.x`, a `1.0.0`/`2.0.0` bump for every breaking change isn't appropriate, so we
follow the SemVer "major version zero" convention:

- **PATCH (`0.2.x`)** — bug fixes **and** backward-compatible additions (new endpoints, optional fields,
  new opt-in features). The default for ongoing work.
- **MINOR (`0.3.0`, `0.4.0`, …)** — **breaking changes** (removed/renamed fields, changed payload
  semantics, deployment-topology changes). A breaking change does **not** stay in `0.2.x`.
- Every breaking change ships with a prominent **⚠️ callout + migration note** in the CHANGELOG and the
  GitHub release, because the version number alone won't fully signal it pre-1.0.

> Note: `0.2.8` shipped one breaking change (webhook `type` neutralization, #270) as a patch — that
> predates this policy and is documented with a migration note; the policy applies from `0.2.9` onward.

## 15.3 Phase 1: MVP (Month 1-3)

### v0.3.0 — Engine pluggability & plugin layer (Released)

`0.3.0` shipped as a **breaking** release (per §15.2). It introduced a pluggable engine layer
(`ENGINE_TYPE` env var: `whatsapp-web.js` default or `baileys` for a browser-free alternative loaded
lazily), moved Puppeteer/browser config out of the neutral engine contract (#265), and added a Tier-2
plugin capability layer (`ctx.messages` / `ctx.engine`; `PluginContext.getService` removed).
Ships with a migration guide.

### v0.4.0 — Single-port deployment (Released)

`0.4.0` shipped as a **breaking** release. The dashboard SPA is now served directly from the API on its
own port (default `:2785`) via `@nestjs/serve-static`; the bundled Traefik service is removed (#275,
#276). Use your own reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, a cloud load balancer) for TLS/public exposure.
`SERVE_DASHBOARD=false` opts out. The `DASHBOARD_PORT`, `PROXY_ENABLED`, and `DASHBOARD_ENABLED` env
vars are removed. Ships with a migration guide.

#### Incremental themes — SDK, Developer Tools & Observability

Delivered additively whenever ready, per SemVer (not gated to one version). Prometheus metrics shipped
in `0.2.2` and the five client SDKs across `0.7.3`–`0.8.19`; the rest remain open.

### Integration Fabric — inbound integrations for plugins (in progress)

A core substrate that lets sandboxed marketplace plugins implement bidirectional external integrations
(helpdesk agent inboxes, chatbot flow builders, CRMs) **without running their own server**. Until now a
plugin could only make outbound calls; the Integration Fabric adds a governed **inbound** path — the core
receives a signature-verified webhook, dedups and queues it, and hands it to the plugin, which replies to
the WhatsApp chat through a normalized capability. The core owns ingress, verification, ordering,
delivery, and the dead-letter queue; the plugin owns only provider-specific logic. Plugins consume it
through a stable, versioned **Integration SDK (v1)**. Motivated by #553.

Delivered in phases (additive; see [25 - Integration Fabric](./25-integration-fabric.md) for the
architecture and design rationale):

| Phase | Scope                                                                                                                                                                          | Status                         |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| P0    | Core substrate: inbound webhook RPC, `@Public` ingress endpoint with HMAC-over-raw-body verification, plugin-instance primitive, normalized send capability, identity/dedup/DLQ tables, ingress queue. SDK v1 frozen. | ✅ Merged (internal substrate) |
| P1    | Scale-correctness: per-conversation FIFO ordering, per-instance fairness, DLQ redrive, bot/human handover.                                                                    | ✅ Merged (internal substrate) |
| P2    | Operator provisioning (mint plugin instances and secrets, dashboard) + the first adapter (helpdesk inbox) shipped as a marketplace plugin — closes #553 end-to-end.           | ✅ Shipped (provisioning `0.8.0`; adapter needs `0.8.7`+) |
| P3    | A second ingress adapter — validates the substrate generalizes beyond the first consumer.                                                                                     | ✅ Shipped (`supabase-otp-hook`) |
| P4    | Developer experience: SDK reference docs, compatibility test suite, multi-node routing.                                                                                       | 📋 Planned                     |

> **Provisioning is operator-facing since `0.8.0`.** An ADMIN key mints a per-plugin instance and its
> ingress secret through `POST /api/integration/plugins/:pluginId/instances`, and rotates that secret
> through `POST /api/integration/plugins/:pluginId/instances/:instanceId/regenerate-secret`; both are also
> reachable from the **Instances** tab of the dashboard plugin dialog. Rotation is a hard cutover — the old
> secret stops verifying the moment the new one is minted, so a dual-secret grace window is still open.
> `chatwoot-adapter` is P2's helpdesk adapter and needs a gateway on `0.8.7`+. P3 is closed by
> `supabase-otp-hook`, the second official ingress plugin — a different vehicle than the chatbot flow
> builder this row originally named, but it is what proved the substrate generalizes to an independent
> consumer. Adapters ship from the
> [OpenWA-plugins](https://github.com/rmyndharis/OpenWA-plugins) catalog, so consult that repository for
> each plugin's declared capabilities. P4 remains open: the published SDK reference, a compatibility test
> suite, and multi-node routing.

## 15.7 Cutting a Release

Releases are cut by a maintainer from `main`. There is no release branch and no release PR: the
version bump lands as a single commit on `main`, and pushing the tag hands everything else to
`.github/workflows/release.yml`.

### Before you start

- `main` is green and holds everything intended for the release. Cross-check the merged PRs against
  the `[Unreleased]` entries: `git log <last-tag>..HEAD --oneline`.
- Working tree clean, on `main`, and `git config user.email` is the intended author identity.
- The release job needs `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` / `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` (promotion logs into both
  registries before applying any tag) and optionally `RELEASE_PAT` (authors the GitHub Release as a
  user rather than the bot). Check with `gh secret list`.
- Pick the version per [15.2](#152-version-numbering). Pre-1.0, a release containing **any**
  breaking change is a MINOR — patch releases carry none.

### The release commit

Exactly four files change. Nothing else belongs in this commit.

```bash
npm version --no-git-tag-version <version>   # package.json + package-lock.json
npm run openapi:export                        # openapi.json info.version follows package.json
```

Then in `CHANGELOG.md`, insert the new heading directly under the retained, now-empty
`## [Unreleased]` — the accumulated entries fall under it by position:

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

## [<version>] - <YYYY-MM-DD>
```

`## [<version>]` is not cosmetic: `npm run check:versions` fails without it, and the GitHub Release
body is extracted from this heading to the next `## [`. An absent or misspelled heading silently
degrades the release notes to a bare `Release v<version>`.

### Verify, commit, tag

Run the same gates the tag will run, so a failure costs a local minute rather than a released tag:

```bash
npm run check:versions && npm run openapi:check && npm run lint && npm run format:check
npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json && npm run check:dockerignore
npm audit --audit-level=high
npm test && npm run test:e2e && npm run build
cd dashboard && npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run i18n:check && npm run build && npm run test:unit
```

```bash
git add package.json package-lock.json openapi.json CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore(release): v<version>"
git tag -a v<version> -m "v<version>"
git push origin main --follow-tags
```

The tag must be annotated and `v`-prefixed; `release.yml` triggers on `v*` and refuses to proceed if
the tag string and `package.json` disagree.

### What the tag automates

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A[push tag v*] --> B[lint / test / test-postgres / dashboard]
    B --> C[build]
    C --> D[docker: multi-arch build, staging tag only]
    D --> E[boot-smoke: run the image on amd64 + arm64]
    D --> F[image-scan: Trivy, CRITICAL/HIGH, fixable only]
    E --> G[promote: apply X.Y.Z, X.Y, latest to GHCR + Docker Hub]
    F --> G
    G --> H[verify-published: resolve every ref anonymously]
    H --> I[GitHub Release, notes from the CHANGELOG section]
```

The build publishes **only** a `smoke-<run_id>` staging tag. Release tags are applied by `promote`,
after the image has both booted on each architecture and passed the vulnerability scan, so a tag
never points at an image that was not tested. `verify-published` then re-resolves every promoted ref
with no registry login, asserting public pullability and digest identity on both platforms. The
GitHub Release is gated on all of it.

Prereleases (`-rc`, `-beta`, `-alpha` in the tag) skip the mutable `X.Y` and `latest` channels and
are flagged prerelease on GitHub.

### When a gate fails

Everything from `promote` onward is skipped, so no release tag reaches either registry and no GitHub
Release is created — the previous release stays intact. Confirm that is what happened, fix the cause
on `main`, then re-tag the version **only if nothing was published under it**:

```bash
git push origin :refs/tags/v<version>   # delete the remote tag
git tag -d v<version>
# ... commit the fix ...
git tag -a v<version> -m "v<version>" && git push origin v<version>
```

Re-using a version is safe precisely because nothing was published under it. A version that DID
publish before a defect was found must not be re-tagged — never move or reuse an already-pushed tag;
supersede it with a new release instead (e.g. `v0.10.3` → `v0.10.4`).

Two failure classes are worth anticipating because they depend on the outside world rather than on
the change being released:

- **`npm audit --audit-level=high`** in the release gate is time-dependent: a tree that was clean
  last week can fail on a newly published advisory.
- **The image scan reads the base image**, including the dependency tree bundled inside its npm CLI,
  which `npm audit` never sees. Accepted findings live in `.trivyignore`, each with a written
  justification and the condition for removing it.

### After the release

```bash
gh run list --workflow=release.yml --limit 1
gh release view v<version>
docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/rmyndharis/openwa:<version>
docker buildx imagetools inspect docker.io/rmyndharis/openwa:latest
```

Do the registry checks logged **out**. A promotion can look green while the tags are unreachable to
everyone else — that is the failure mode that took `latest`, `0.10` and `0.10.5` offline after
v0.10.5 published its GitHub Release.

Upgrading a Compose deployment is `git pull && docker compose up -d --build`: the bundled
`docker-compose.yml` **builds** the API service rather than pulling it, so `docker compose pull` is
a no-op for OpenWA itself.
