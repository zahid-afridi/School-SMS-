# 11 - Operational Runbooks

## 11.1 Overview

This document contains Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for OpenWA operations, including incident response, maintenance procedures, and troubleshooting guides.

### Runbook Structure

Each runbook follows this format:

```
## Runbook: [Title]
### Trigger
### Impact
### Prerequisites
### Steps
### Verification
### Rollback
```

## 11.2 Incident Response

### Runbook: Service Down

**Trigger:** Health check failing, API not responding

**Impact:** All sessions affected, messages not processing

**Prerequisites:**
- SSH access to server
- Docker CLI access
- Database access

**Steps:**

```bash
# 1. Check container status
docker compose ps

# 2. Check container logs. Every `docker compose … openwa-api` below names the service as the
#    production docker-compose.yml defines it — on docker-compose.dev.yml that service is called
#    `openwa`, so substitute it there. The bare `docker stats`/`docker restart` forms take the
#    container name, which is `openwa-api` under both files.
docker compose logs --tail=100 openwa-api

# 3. Check system resources
docker stats --no-stream
df -h
free -m

# 4. Identify root cause
# A. Container crashed
docker compose logs openwa-api 2>&1 | grep -i "error\|fatal\|crash"

# B. Out of memory
docker compose logs openwa-api 2>&1 | grep -i "oom\|memory"

# C. Database connection
docker compose logs openwa-api 2>&1 | grep -i "database\|connection refused"

# 5. Apply fix based on cause:

# A. Simple restart
docker compose restart openwa-api

# B. Full restart with cleanup
docker compose down
docker compose up -d

# C. Memory issues - increase limit
# Edit docker-compose.yml and increase memory limit
docker compose up -d

# D. Database issues (built-in PostgreSQL runs as container `openwa-postgres`, both when
#    started via the compose `postgres`/`full` profile and when orchestrated by the app)
docker restart openwa-postgres
# Wait for postgres to be ready
sleep 10
docker compose restart openwa-api
```

**Verification:**

```bash
# Check health
curl http://localhost:2785/api/health

# Check all sessions reconnected (id alongside status — the send below needs the id)
curl -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  http://localhost:2785/api/sessions | jq '.[] | {id, name, status}'

# Send test message ({sessionId} is the UUID from the listing above — session routes
# resolve by id, not by session name)
curl -X POST http://localhost:2785/api/sessions/{sessionId}/messages/send-text \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"chatId": "628xxx@c.us", "text": "Test after restart"}'
```

**Rollback:** Restore from backup if data corruption detected (see Runbook: Restore from Backup)

---

### Runbook: Session Disconnected

**Trigger:** Session status changed to DISCONNECTED, webhook not receiving messages

**Impact:** Single session affected

**Prerequisites:**
- API Key
- Physical access to phone (if QR needed)

**Steps:**

```bash
# 1. Check session status
curl -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  http://localhost:2785/api/sessions/{sessionId}

# 2. Check if auto-reconnect is working
docker compose logs openwa-api 2>&1 | grep -i "{sessionId}" | tail -20

# 3. Try session restart (stop then start — there is no /restart route)
curl -X POST -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  http://localhost:2785/api/sessions/{sessionId}/stop
curl -X POST -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  http://localhost:2785/api/sessions/{sessionId}/start

# 4. Wait for reconnection (30 seconds)
sleep 30

# 5. Check status again
curl -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  http://localhost:2785/api/sessions/{sessionId}

# 6. If still disconnected, check phone:
#    - Is phone connected to internet?
#    - Is WhatsApp Web still linked in phone settings?
#    - Has the phone been inactive for 14+ days?

# 7. If need to re-scan QR:
#    The endpoint returns a PNG data URL: { "qrCode": "data:image/png;base64,...", "status": "qr_ready" }
curl -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  http://localhost:2785/api/sessions/{sessionId}/qr

# Display QR in terminal: there is no raw/format param — consume the `session.qr`
# webhook/WebSocket event to get the raw QR string for qrencode.
```

**Verification:**

```bash
# Session connected
curl -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  http://localhost:2785/api/sessions/{sessionId} | jq '.status'
# Expected: "ready"

# Test message
curl -X POST http://localhost:2785/api/sessions/{sessionId}/messages/send-text \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"chatId": "628xxx@c.us", "text": "Session reconnected"}'
```

---

### Runbook: High Memory Usage

**Trigger:** Memory usage > 80%, alerts from monitoring

**Impact:** Performance degradation, potential OOM

**Prerequisites:**
- SSH access
- Docker CLI

**Steps:**

```bash
# 1. Check current memory usage (the container is named `openwa-api`)
docker stats --no-stream openwa-api
free -m

# 2. Identify memory consumers
# Process-wide memory: scrape /api/metrics (Prometheus text, Bearer METRICS_TOKEN)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $METRICS_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:2785/api/metrics \
  | grep -E "openwa_process_resident_memory_bytes|openwa_process_heap_used_bytes"

# 3. Check for memory leaks
docker compose logs openwa-api 2>&1 | grep -i "heap\|memory\|gc"

# 4. Immediate actions:

# A. Clear the in-process cache (no runtime cache-clear API — restart the container;
#    if using Redis, flush via redis-cli)
docker compose restart openwa-api

# B. Restart container (will reconnect sessions)
docker compose restart openwa-api

# C. If caused by too many sessions:
# List sessions (no sort param); process memory is in stats/overview (memoryUsage, MB)
curl -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  http://localhost:2785/api/sessions/stats/overview

# Consider removing unused sessions

# 5. Long-term fix:
# Edit docker-compose.yml
# Increase memory limit or reduce max sessions
```

**Verification:**

```bash
# Memory below threshold
docker stats --no-stream openwa-api
# Expected: Memory usage < 80%

# All sessions still connected
curl -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  http://localhost:2785/api/sessions | jq '.[].status'
```

---

### Runbook: Webhook Delivery Failure

**Trigger:** Webhook success rate < 95%, alert from monitoring

For sustained/high-volume webhook traffic, enable Redis-backed dispatch with `QUEUE_ENABLED=true`.
The inline fallback deliberately has bounded concurrency and a bounded waiter queue; overflow is recorded
as a delivery failure rather than retaining payloads without limit.

**Impact:** External systems not receiving events

**Prerequisites:**
- API Key
- Access to webhook endpoint

**Steps:**

```bash
# 1. Check webhook status
curl -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  http://localhost:2785/api/sessions/{sessionId}/webhooks

# 2. Check recent webhook deliveries — this admin-only endpoint lists abandoned deliveries
#    most-recent-first: those that exhausted every retry, plus those never attempted at all
#    (recorded with `attempts: 0` — payload over the cap or an unserializable payload
#    (preflight), inline waiter-queue overflow, or rejection by the shutdown drain).
#    A URL blocked by the SSRF guard never reaches delivery: it is rejected with a 400 when the
#    webhook is registered, so it appears in no delivery-failure row.
curl -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  "http://localhost:2785/api/webhooks/delivery-failures?sessionId={sessionId}&limit=20"

# Attempts still in flight (not yet exhausted) only appear in the server logs:
docker compose logs openwa-api 2>&1 | grep -i "webhook" | tail -20

# 3. Identify failure reason:
# A. Endpoint not responding
curl -v https://your-webhook-endpoint.com/openwa

# B. SSL certificate issues
curl -v --insecure https://your-webhook-endpoint.com/openwa

# C. Timeout
curl -v --max-time 30 https://your-webhook-endpoint.com/openwa

# D. Authentication failed
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer token" \
  https://your-webhook-endpoint.com/openwa

# 4. Test webhook delivery
curl -X POST -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  http://localhost:2785/api/sessions/{sessionId}/webhooks/{webhookId}/test

# 5. Fix based on cause:

# A. Update webhook URL
curl -X PUT http://localhost:2785/api/sessions/{sessionId}/webhooks/{webhookId} \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://new-endpoint.com/webhook"}'

# B. Update authentication
curl -X PUT http://localhost:2785/api/sessions/{sessionId}/webhooks/{webhookId} \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer new-token"}}'

# C. Temporarily disable and re-enable (toggle the `active` boolean)
curl -X PUT http://localhost:2785/api/sessions/{sessionId}/webhooks/{webhookId} \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"active": false}'

curl -X PUT http://localhost:2785/api/sessions/{sessionId}/webhooks/{webhookId} \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"active": true}'

# 6. Retry failed deliveries
# No retry-failed API — failed deliveries auto-retry with exponential backoff (doc 06 §6.6)
```

**Verification:**

```bash
# Webhook test successful
curl -X POST -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  http://localhost:2785/api/sessions/{sessionId}/webhooks/{webhookId}/test
# Expected: {"success": true, "statusCode": 200}

# No new permanent delivery failures for this session
curl -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  "http://localhost:2785/api/webhooks/delivery-failures?sessionId={sessionId}&limit=5"
```

## 11.3 Maintenance Procedures

### Runbook: Scheduled Maintenance

**Trigger:** Planned maintenance window

**Impact:** Service downtime during maintenance

**Prerequisites:**
- Scheduled maintenance window
- Backup verified
- User notification sent

**Steps:**

```bash
# 1. Pre-maintenance checks (1 hour before)
curl http://localhost:2785/api/health/ready
docker stats --no-stream

# 2. Notify users (via webhook or external system)
# Send maintenance notification

# 3. Create backup
./scripts/backup.sh

# Verify backup (backup.sh writes $BACKUP_DIR/openwa-backup-<timestamp>.tar.gz,
# BACKUP_DIR defaults to ./backups — it creates no dated subdirectories)
ls -la ./backups/openwa-backup-*.tar.gz

# 4. Stop accepting new requests (if using load balancer)
# Remove from load balancer or set to maintenance mode

# 5. Wait for in-flight requests to complete (30 seconds)
sleep 30

# 6. Stop services
docker compose down

# 7. Perform maintenance tasks:
# - System updates
# - Docker updates
# - Configuration changes
# - Database migrations

# 8. Start services
docker compose up -d

# 9. Wait for health
sleep 30
curl http://localhost:2785/api/health

# 10. Verify all sessions reconnected
curl -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  http://localhost:2785/api/sessions | jq '.[].status'

# 11. Re-enable in load balancer

# 12. Send maintenance complete notification
```

**Verification:**

```bash
# All services healthy
curl http://localhost:2785/api/health/ready

# All sessions connected
curl -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  http://localhost:2785/api/sessions | jq '[.[] | select(.status == "ready")] | length'

# Test message flow
# Send test message and verify webhook received
```

---

### Runbook: Version Upgrade

**Trigger:** New version release

**Impact:** Brief downtime during upgrade

**Prerequisites:**
- Backup completed
- Release notes reviewed
- Breaking changes identified
- Rollback plan ready

**Steps:**

```bash
# 1. Review release notes
# Check for breaking changes, migration requirements

# 2. Create backup (BACKUP_DIR must be set BEFORE the script runs — it defaults to ./backups
#    and the archive is written as $BACKUP_DIR/openwa-backup-<timestamp>.tar.gz)
export BACKUP_DIR="/backups/openwa"
./scripts/backup.sh

# 3. Export the Data DB as JSON alongside the archive (admin key)
curl -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  http://localhost:2785/api/infra/export-data > "$BACKUP_DIR/export-data.json"

# 4. Stop services
docker compose down

# 5. Fetch the new release
# The shipped docker-compose.yml BUILDS openwa-api from source (`build: context: .`) — there is
# no `image:` tag to edit and `docker compose pull` never updates the app, so upgrade the source:
git pull
# or pin to a release: git checkout v<new-version>

# 6. Build the new image
docker compose build openwa-api

# 7. Run database migrations (if any)
# Use migration:run:prod in the production image — `migration:run` needs ts-node + the TS
# source, both stripped from the prod image by `npm ci --omit=dev`.
docker compose run --rm openwa-api npm run migration:run:prod

# 8. Start services
docker compose up -d

# 9. Wait for health
sleep 30
curl http://localhost:2785/api/health

# 10. Verify version
curl http://localhost:2785/api/health | jq '.version'

# 11. Verify all sessions
curl -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  http://localhost:2785/api/sessions

# 12. Test critical flows — send through a live session ({sessionId} from step 11)
curl -X POST http://localhost:2785/api/sessions/{sessionId}/messages/send-text \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"chatId": "628xxx@c.us", "text": "Post-upgrade check"}'
```

> If you deploy the published image instead of building from source — your own compose file with
> `image: ghcr.io/rmyndharis/openwa:<tag>` — replace steps 5-6 with editing that tag and running
> `docker compose pull`.

**Verification:**

```bash
# Correct version
curl http://localhost:2785/api/health | jq '.version'
# Expected: "<new-version>"

# All sessions reconnected
curl -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  http://localhost:2785/api/sessions | jq '.[].status'
```

**Rollback:**

```bash
# 1. Stop services
docker compose down

# 2. Check out the previous release and rebuild the image
git checkout v<old-version>
docker compose build openwa-api

# 3. Restore from the pre-upgrade backup (both DBs + sessions) — the archive step 2 produced is
#    "$BACKUP_DIR/openwa-backup-<timestamp>.tar.gz"
./scripts/restore.sh "$BACKUP_DIR/openwa-backup-<timestamp>.tar.gz"

# 4. Start with old version
docker compose up -d

# 5. Verify rollback (note: readiness is at /api/health/ready)
curl -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" http://localhost:2785/api/health
```

### Runbook: Database Backup

**Trigger:** Daily schedule, before maintenance, before upgrade

**Impact:** None (online backup)

**Prerequisites:**
- Sufficient disk space
- Backup storage accessible

**Steps:**

Use the repo's `scripts/backup.sh`. Its explicit scope covers the load-bearing state below — critically
including `main.sqlite`, the auth (API-key) + audit DB, which an earlier version of this runbook omitted.
User-managed files outside that list (for example the project-level `.env`) must be protected separately:

```bash
# scripts/backup.sh captures:
#   - main.sqlite   — auth (API keys) + audit log   (ALWAYS SQLite; MAIN_DATABASE_NAME, default ./data/main.sqlite)
#   - openwa.sqlite — user data                      (DATABASE_NAME, default ./data/openwa.sqlite;
#                                                     or a pg_dump when DATABASE_TYPE=postgres)
#   - sessions/     — whatsapp-web.js state (SESSION_DATA_PATH)
#   - baileys/      — Baileys credentials (BAILEYS_AUTH_DIR)
#   - media/        — local media                    (skipped automatically when STORAGE_TYPE=s3)
#   - plugin-packages/ — installed plugin code from PLUGINS_DIR
#   - plugin-state/    — registry + ctx.storage state under OPENWA_DATA_DIR
#   - .env.generated / .api-key — generated configuration and bootstrap secret
#
# The database paths resolve exactly like the app: the explicit MAIN_DATABASE_NAME /
# DATABASE_NAME env path wins, otherwise the fixed ./data defaults — they are NOT derived from
# OPENWA_DATA_DIR. A missing source database fails the run (no silent empty backup), the finished
# archive is checked to contain every configured database, and with the sqlite3 CLI present the
# databases are snapshotted online via .backup (otherwise plain-copied with a CONSISTENCY-WARNING
# marker inside the archive).

# Run from the repo root (database defaults are ./data/...; state dirs follow OPENWA_DATA_DIR):
./scripts/backup.sh

# Customize via environment:
OPENWA_DATA_DIR=/srv/openwa/data \
  BACKUP_DIR=/backups/openwa \
  DATABASE_TYPE=postgres DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:5432/openwa \
  ./scripts/backup.sh
```

> The data directory is a Docker **named volume** (`openwa-data`) in the production
> compose. Run the script where that volume is mounted — e.g. point `OPENWA_DATA_DIR`
> at the volume's mountpoint, or run it inside a container with `/app/data` mounted.
>
> The scripts resolve every other path the way the application does: an explicit environment value
> first, then `./.env`, then `<data dir>/.env.generated`. Settings made through Dashboard >
> Infrastructure therefore apply without being restated on the command line. Two caveats when
> operating directly on the host mount: a path recorded inside the container (`/app/data/...`) is not
> host-visible, so override it in the environment; and a value written with quotes or a trailing `#`
> comment is reported and skipped rather than guessed at, so pass those explicitly too.

**Verification:**

```bash
# The archive MUST contain main.sqlite, the configured data store, and the auth directory for the
# selected engine (sessions/ for whatsapp-web.js or baileys/ for Baileys).
tar -tzf ./backups/openwa-backup-*.tar.gz
```

> Backup archives contain API keys, provider credentials, WhatsApp auth state, and plugin secrets.
> Encrypt them at rest, restrict access, and never publish or attach them to support tickets.

---

### Runbook: Restore from Backup

**Trigger:** Data corruption, accidental deletion, disaster recovery

**Impact:** Service downtime during restore

**Prerequisites:**
- Valid backup file
- Sufficient disk space
- SSH access

**Steps:**

Use the repo's `scripts/restore.sh`. It restores `main.sqlite` (auth/audit) and a SQLite data store;
for PostgreSQL it stages `database.sql` for the explicit import below. It also restores
whatsapp-web.js/Baileys auth state, local media, plugins, and generated secret/config files. It snapshots
the current data dir first so a bad restore can be undone:

```bash
# 1. Stop the app (so files are quiescent)
docker compose down

# 2. Restore from an archive produced by scripts/backup.sh
#    (databases land on MAIN_DATABASE_NAME / DATABASE_NAME, default ./data/... — the same paths
#    the app reads; non-DB state follows OPENWA_DATA_DIR. Pass --strict to refuse an archive
#    whose CONSISTENCY-WARNING marker reports plain-copied, possibly-torn database snapshots)
./scripts/restore.sh ./backups/openwa-backup-<timestamp>.tar.gz

# 3. (Postgres only) the archive contains database.sql — import it manually:
#    psql "$DATABASE_URL" < ./data/database.sql

# 4. Start the app and CONFIRM an existing API key still authenticates
docker compose up -d
curl -s -X POST -H "X-API-Key: <an-existing-key>" http://localhost:2785/api/auth/validate
```

> `main.sqlite` carries the hashed API keys and audit log; `.api-key`, when retained by the original
> installation, carries the plaintext bootstrap admin key. After restore, verify that both expected files
> were present in the archive and that the client is using the original plaintext key. Re-running backup
> after the source state or key has already been lost cannot recover it; use an older valid archive or the
> documented credential-recovery procedure instead.

**Verification:**

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:2785/api/health

# Verify sessions
curl -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  http://localhost:2785/api/sessions

# Verify data integrity ({sessionId} is the UUID from the listing above — session routes
# resolve by id, not by session name)
curl -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  "http://localhost:2785/api/sessions/{sessionId}/messages?limit=1"
```

## 11.4 Monitoring & Alerting

### Alert Response Matrix

| Alert | Severity | Response Time | Runbook |
|-------|----------|---------------|---------|
| Service Down | Critical | 5 min | Service Down |
| High Memory | Warning | 30 min | High Memory Usage |
| Session Disconnected | Warning | 15 min | Session Disconnected |
| Webhook Failures > 5% | Warning | 30 min | Webhook Delivery Failure |
| Disk Space < 10% | Critical | 15 min | Disk Space Low |
| Certificate Expiry < 7 days | Warning | 24 hours | Certificate Renewal |

### Runbook: Certificate Renewal

**Trigger:** Certificate expiring in < 7 days

**Impact:** HTTPS will fail when expired

**Steps:**

```bash
# Using certbot
sudo certbot renew

# Verify renewal
sudo certbot certificates

# Restart nginx/proxy
sudo systemctl restart nginx
# or
docker compose restart nginx

# Verify HTTPS
curl -v https://api.your-domain.com/api/health
```

---

### Runbook: Disk Space Low

**Trigger:** Disk usage > 90%

**Impact:** Service may fail to write data

**Steps:**

```bash
# 1. Check disk usage
df -h

# 2. Find large files
du -sh /var/lib/docker/*
du -sh ./data/*
# The app writes no log files — it logs to stdout, so log volume is whatever the Docker
# log driver retains for the container:
du -sh "$(docker inspect --format='{{.LogPath}}' openwa-api)"

# 3. Clean up:

# A. Docker cleanup
docker system prune -af
docker volume prune -f

# B. Container log (Docker-managed; cap it at the daemon/compose log-driver level to stop it
#    growing back)
sudo truncate -s 0 "$(docker inspect --format='{{.LogPath}}' openwa-api)"

# C. Old backups
find /backups -name "*.tar.gz" -mtime +30 -delete

# D. Message attachments (if backed up)
# Warning: This deletes media files
find ./data/media -mtime +30 -delete

# 4. Verify
df -h
```

## 11.5 Capacity Planning

### Resource Estimation

> **Engine note:** The figures below apply to the default `whatsapp-web.js` engine
> (Chromium/Puppeteer). With `ENGINE_TYPE=baileys` (browser-free), memory per session
> is significantly lower — re-baseline with your own load profile.

```
Per Session Requirements (ENGINE_TYPE=whatsapp-web.js):
- Memory: 300-500MB (average 400MB)
- CPU: 0.1-0.2 cores idle, 0.5 cores peak
- Disk: 100MB base + ~1KB per message

Server Sizing:
┌──────────────┬─────────┬──────┬───────────┐
│ Sessions     │ RAM     │ CPU  │ Disk      │
├──────────────┼─────────┼──────┼───────────┤
│ 1-3          │ 2 GB    │ 2    │ 20 GB     │
│ 4-10         │ 4 GB    │ 4    │ 50 GB     │
│ 11-20        │ 8 GB    │ 8    │ 100 GB    │
│ 21-50        │ 16 GB   │ 16   │ 200 GB    │
│ 50+          │ 32 GB+  │ 32+  │ 500 GB+   │
└──────────────┴─────────┴──────┴───────────┘
```
